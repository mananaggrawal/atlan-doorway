# NOTE: the branch model is deliberately NOT a build arg any more. It used to
# have to be present during `vite build` because the values were substituted
# into the frontend bundle — which made the image deployment-specific and meant
# renaming a branch required a rebuild. The browser is now served them by
# `GET /api/config` at boot, so this image runs against any deployment and the
# runtime `environment:` block is the only place they are set.

# Build shared + core-backend (tsc → dist), then the SPA (Vite). `pnpm --filter`
# routes through pnpm's workspace binary links.

# Third-party licence notices for the image. MIT/BSD/Apache all permit
# redistribution only if their copyright notice ships with the distribution,
# and Vite strips comments out of the bundle — so the notices are re-attached
# as a file here. Generated rather than copied in: the file is .gitignore'd
# because its content depends on which platform's optional binaries are
# installed, and this stage is the one that resolved them. Also fails the build
# outright on a denied licence (GPL/AGPL/…), so a bad dependency cannot ship.

# git backs every workspace operation (clone/commit/push of the KB repo).
# tini is PID 1: the reaper. The server spawns git, MCP servers and the
# shell tool's commands; a grandchild that outlives its parent reparents to
# PID 1, and a node process there never reaps it — zombies accumulate until
# the host cannot fork (a self-hosted deployment reached ~4,500 tasks that
# way). The shipped compose files set `init: true` for the same reason, but a
# deployment built from this Dockerfile alone — a Coolify "Dockerfile" app, a
# hand-written compose — got no reaper. Baking it in means no deployment can
# forget it; `init: true` on top is harmless. (When both are present, Docker's
# own init takes PID 1 and this tini runs under it — the `-s` on the
# ENTRYPOINT registers it as a child subreaper for exactly that case, so it
# still reaps its subtree instead of warning on every boot.)

# Bake the deployed commit sha into the image so `GET /api/health` can report

# it arrives as ONE build arg, SOURCE_COMMIT, the name Coolify gives the
# checked-out commit: CI passes `--build-arg SOURCE_COMMIT=<sha>`, Coolify
# appends `--build-arg SOURCE_COMMIT` to its compose build (with "Include
# SOURCE_COMMIT in build" enabled), and a manual build passes
# `$(git rev-parse HEAD)`. Unset, health reports 'unknown'.

# Baked under a DIFFERENT name on purpose. A runtime environment variable

## Context

The hosted MCP proxy builds a fresh SDK `Server` per session in `packages/core-backend/src/modules/mcp/mcp.service.ts` (`createSession`) and passes only `capabilities`. The SDK (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.30) accepts `instructions` in the same options object and returns it in the initialize result; `Client.getInstructions()` reads it back. Claude Code, Claude Desktop and Cursor place that text in the model's system prompt. claude.ai on the web, the Agent SDK and Cline drop it (anthropics/claude-ai-mcp #93, open), so the handshake alone does not reach the client the External agent access page advertises first. The one thing every client shows the model before it decides to call anything is the tool description, which claude.ai truncates near 500 characters. The comment in `packages/mcp-core/src/meta-tools.ts` still says "there is no system prompt over MCP"; this change adds that system prompt and keeps the code-mode protocol in its tool description for the clients that never see it.

Everything a hosted session needs that depends on the caller's access is fetched over loopback with the caller's bearer (`fetchManualTemplates`, `fetchSkillList`), so ACL filtering lives once behind the REST surface. The preamble is read with platform privileges, so that reason does not apply to it; the proxy reads it in-process. The local bridge (`packages/doorway-mcp/src/server.ts`) registers the hosted endpoint as a UTCP manual of type `mcp`; UTCP does not forward a remote server's instructions, so the bridge needs its own fetch, as it already does for skills through `callKbTool`.

The KB template ships a managed root `AGENTS.md` that `template-files.step.ts` rewrites on every boot and `.doorwayignore` hides. Nothing reads it at runtime. It already tells teams to keep their own conventions in files of their own. `roles.yaml` and `groups.yaml` are the precedent for platform configuration that lives in the repository: root files, admin-only through the root `access.md`, edited from an admin page.

Deployment settings (`modules/settings/deployment-settings.service.ts`) are env-first, cached per process, treat a blank save as "keep", render as single-line fields and hold no history. They fit boot-time connection values, not a multi-paragraph text an admin revises.

The default-branch workspace is a working tree: the app's own commits and merges refresh it, and a push made directly to the git host appears on the next pull. Skills, tools and access rules are read from that tree with that freshness, and so is the preamble.

Stakeholders: KB admins who know what their repository holds; every user whose agent connects; the enterprise overlay, which plans an AX overhaul and will want to append its own graph-aware summaries.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Every MCP session, hosted or through the local bridge, tells the model what Doorway is and to search the knowledge base before answering from memory, on every client, including the ones that drop the handshake.
- Admins write the per-deployment part themselves, per knowledge base, with history and review.
- One composer produces the text; the hosted proxy, the local bridge and the admin page all read its output.
- Zero admin work still improves every deployment (the platform header and the fixed prefix line alone).
- Bounded cost: the text lands in every conversation's system prompt and on four tool descriptions, so both sizes are capped; the admin-owned preamble and its cap are visible in the app.

**Non-Goals:**
- Per-user or per-plugin instructions scoped by access. Recorded in `TODOS.md`.
- An auto-generated index of readable folders or ontologies. Recorded in `TODOS.md`.
- Returning the text from `start_session` as a third channel. Recorded in `TODOS.md`, gated on the manual eval in this change.
- A database-backed or non-versioned preamble setting. The inline form still writes the repository file through the normal workspace save path.
- Moving the code-mode protocol out of the `call_tool_chain` description into the header. Dead: the clients that drop the handshake are the reason it must stay in the description.
- An adoption marker on a pre-existing `mcp-description.md`. Considered in review and rejected: a forgotten marker silently disables the feature, which is likelier than a root file with this Doorway-specific name that was not meant for Doorway. The card shows the broadcast text to every admin.

## Decisions

**1. Two channels: `instructions` on the initialize handshake, and a purpose prefix on four tool descriptions.**
The handshake is the channel Claude Code, Claude Desktop and Cursor inject without the model acting. claude.ai web, the Agent SDK and Cline ignore it, and tool descriptions are the only pre-call channel every client honours, so the hosted `tools/list` handler prepends a short prefix to the descriptions of `start_session`, `grep`, `list_files` and `read_file`, purpose line first because claude.ai cuts descriptions near 500 characters. The bridge discovers its tools from that listing, so it inherits the prefix. Every other tool's description is untouched. Alternatives considered: a prompt named `orientation` (invisible unless picked); a longer `start_session` description (already long, and still one tool); a plugin carrying a skill (reaches only readers of that plugin, right for team notes later, wrong for "what is this KB"); echoing the text from a tool result (arrives after the model has already decided whether to call the server; kept as a possible third channel in `TODOS.md`).

**2. Two layers: a code-owned header, then the admin's preamble.**
Notion, Sitefire and similar connectors send a static vendor string because every workspace on their product has the same shape. Doorway deployments do not, so the vendor writes only the mechanics and the "search here first" rule; the subject matter comes from the admin. The header, final:

> Doorway is this organisation's knowledge base, together with the skills and tools its teams have approved. Its content is specific to the organisation and is not in your training data. Before answering a question about the organisation, its people, customers, products, processes, projects or internal terms, search the knowledge base: call `start_session` once, then `grep` for the key terms, `list_files` to orient, and `read_file` what matches. Prefer what you find there over memory or the web, and say so when the knowledge base is silent on something the organisation should have documented. Skills are available as prompts and through `list_skills` and `get_skill`.

The tool prefix is a fixed imperative line, then the preamble's first non-heading paragraph, capped together at 300 characters:

> This organisation's knowledge base. Search it before answering from memory.

The fixed line always leads, so an admin's first edit never removes the instruction from the clients that only see the prefix, and a preamble that opens with a heading still yields a sensible purpose line.

**3. Source of the admin part: a file in the KB repository, not a database setting.**
Versioned, reviewable through change requests, exported with the repository, and something an agent can itself propose an edit to ("the KB gained a Permitting folder; add it to the preamble"). It is also the convention coding agents already use for instructions about a body of content (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`). A database setting would be simpler to build and is not wrong; it just discards the one advantage a git-backed knowledge base has here. Rejected: a section inside the managed `AGENTS.md` (rewritten every boot; marker-based partial rewrites are fragile). The file is read from the default-branch workspace with the same freshness as skills and access rules: app commits and merges refresh it; a direct push appears on the next pull.

**4. Location and name: `mcp-description.md` at the repository root.**
Root is where deployment-wide configuration already lives (`access.md`, `roles.yaml`, `AGENTS.md`), and the root `access.md` makes it admin-writable by default. Lowercase to match `access.md` and `roles.yaml`. Alternatives: root `README.md` (git hosts render it as the front page, but many repositories already carry one with unrelated content, and the name does not say agents read it); `KnowledgeBase/README.md` (visible to more readers, but it is content territory, and enterprise knowledge validation may treat it as a node). The template `.doorwayignore` lists the root-anchored `/mcp-description.md`, and startup adds that default to existing knowledge bases unless an operator has an explicit negation or an unanchored rule of their own. An unanchored rule the platform itself wrote, which an earlier release shipped, is respelled to the anchored form rather than left standing: the bare name also hides an ordinary knowledge page called `mcp-description.md` anywhere in the tree, and provenance is the platform comment above the line, as it is for every other rule this step owns. The merged-tree hook also removes the exact root path so a cached tree or optimistic overlay cannot briefly expose the control file; nested files with the same basename remain ordinary content. Inside the workspace the repository is the `<kbDirName>/` folder, so the read and write path is `${kbDirName}/mcp-description.md`. The External agent access card loads and saves that path through the normal workspace APIs instead of navigating to the Knowledge editor.

**5. Read with platform privileges.**
The root is default-deny for reads, so reading as the caller would silently give non-admins nothing. The preamble is a broadcast the admin writes for every connected agent; the card says so in plain words. Folder names in the preamble can reach users who cannot read those folders. That is the admin's call, and the card states it. The same default means a non-admin cannot open the file in the editor; proposing a change through a change request needs root read, which an admin may grant deliberately.

**6. One pure composer, one reader, one route.**
`packages/core-backend/src/modules/agent-instructions/compose.ts` exports the header constant, the fixed prefix line and `composeAgentInstructions(preamble: string | null)`, which strips comments, applies both caps and returns `{ instructions, header, preamble, toolPrefix, toolPrefixLine, truncated, preambleChars, toolPrefixTruncated, toolPrefixChars, unterminatedComment }` (the parts let the card separate the platform and admin text; both channel counts remain part of the API). A reader beside it ensures the default-branch workspace exists (`getOrCreateForBranch(DEFAULT_BRANCH)`) and reads the file symlink-safe (lstat, then an `O_NOFOLLOW` open read through the checked handle): ENOENT is the only absence and yields `null`; a symlink or other non-regular entry is refused; any other error throws, the same contract as the plugin archive route. `GET /api/agent/instructions` mounts beside `all-tools` on the tools router, defined in `agent-instructions.routes.ts`, under `manualAuth`, which accepts connection keys, internal tokens and browser JWTs, answers with the composer's result, and sends `Cache-Control: no-store` because the text is privileged. The route serves the local bridge and the frontend card. No separate service class: the reader is one function.

**7. The hosted proxy composes in-process at session creation, no loopback, no cache.**
`McpService` receives the reader at construction (wired in `create-core-services.ts` like `SkillService`) and calls it in `createSession`. A thrown read error falls back to the header and the fixed prefix line with a logged warning; a session never fails to initialise over its preamble. Loopback was considered and rejected: it exists to apply the caller's ACL once, and this read has no ACL, so it would only add a bearer, a failure path and a bounded timeout to the initialize path. An edit reaches the next session without a restart.

**8. The deployment advertises the capability; the local bridge fetches only when it is advertised.**
`GET /api/config` gains `agentInstructions: true`. `resolveDeployment(config)` in `deployment.ts` returns `{ mcpUrl, agentInstructions }` from the one config fetch the server already makes, and `resolveMcpUrl` remains as a wrapper returning `.mcpUrl` because it is a public export consumed as a string by the CLI. When the flag is present the bridge calls `GET /api/agent/instructions` before building its `Server` and passes the text as `instructions`; when absent it logs one line naming the older deployment and sends none. Any failure of the fetch itself (network, non-2xx, malformed body) logs and starts without instructions. A 404 heuristic was rejected after verification: an unknown `/api/*` path on an older deployment falls past the agent router into the JWT-protected mounts and answers 401, which `getJson` reads as an expired sign-in.

**9. Comment stripping, two caps, code-point cuts.**
HTML comments let the template explain itself and let admins keep notes without sending them to every agent. An unterminated `<!--` strips everything after it, so a private note can never leak on the most likely editing slip; the composer reports `unterminatedComment` and the card warns. The inline editor removes comments from the editable value, retains them in the backing source when saving, and closes an unterminated private comment before the new public text. The preamble cap is 6,000 characters, roughly 1,500 tokens, enough for a table of contents and conventions, small enough to sit in every conversation; over the cap the text is cut and a marker names the file to shorten. The prefix cap is 300 characters. Both cuts land on a code-point boundary, never inside a surrogate pair, so a multi-byte preamble truncates cleanly. Counts are reported before truncation; the card shows the preamble count while the prefix count remains available in the endpoint response.

**10. Seeding: `REQUIRED_FILES`, never the managed refresh, and the template is one comment.**
`mcp-description.md` joins `REQUIRED_FILES` in `template-files.step.ts`, so a missing file is added on every protected branch at the startup phase and an existing one is left alone, like `access.md`. Only `AGENTS.md` gets the managed rewrite. The template file is a single HTML comment carrying the explanation and the starter skeleton, whose first line says that removing the wrapper broadcasts the text; a never-edited file therefore sends the header alone. An admin who wants no preamble empties the file; the top-up restores only a missing file. Every protected branch carries its own copy, as every root file does; MCP sends the default branch's copy, and an agent working in a clone reads the copy on its branch, which the `AGENTS.md` pointer says.

**11. Connection setup comes first; agent instructions are a separate card with inline admin editing.**
External agent access first shows one card containing Your agent, Marketplaces and Autonomous agents. A peer card below it explains what every connected agent receives: the fixed platform message in a closed drawer, then the admin-owned description with `N / 6,000 characters`. The short-prefix preview and repository implementation copy are omitted because they made the editable part look like two settings. The prefix channel is still named in one place: the warning shown when the composer reports it truncated, which names the cap, the length and the clients affected. A preview of a derived channel is noise; a warning that content is being cut is not, and an admin cannot act on it without knowing who sees the cut. Admins get an inline Edit action once `kbDirName` is known; it loads the default-branch source, shows only agent-visible text, and saves through the workspace write path while retaining private HTML comments. Non-admins see the same read-only preview without an Edit action. Loading and save failures stay inline; even if the composed preview fails, an admin can still open the inline description editor, and the post-save preview refresh cannot be undone by a slower initial load resolving after it.

Two write-path guarantees hold the editing story up. The save sends the loaded bytes as an `ifMatch` precondition, which `PUT /api/workspace/:id/file` compares under the per-path lock it already takes, so an editor left open while another admin saves is refused with a 409 instead of putting its stale private comments back and dropping theirs. And `GET /api/workspace/:id/file` answers 404 for an absent file alone, giving every other read failure its own status, because the editor treats 404 as "no file yet, open empty" and an unreadable file must not take that path.

**12. The stale comment in `meta-tools.ts` is rewritten in this change.**
It now says the header arrives as initialize instructions and the code-mode protocol stays in the tool description because several clients drop that field, with a pointer to the composer.

**13. Eval: manual before/after on the three clients that matter, plus deterministic assertions.**
One fixed organisation-specific question asked in Claude Code, claude.ai web and Cline with and without the preamble, results recorded in the PR description. A unit test pins that each prefixed description starts with the fixed line and that the prefix is at most 300 characters. An automated eval harness is recorded in `TODOS.md`.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- [Every conversation pays the token cost, twice over on the four tools] → two server-side caps, one visible preamble count in the card, a short header, and a shorter fixed line.
- [Folder names reach users who cannot read them] → documented in the card and the template comment; the admin decides what to name.
- [A client ignores `instructions`] → the prefix carries the imperative and the purpose line to every client; a `start_session` echo is recorded as a possible third channel.
- [A repository already has an unrelated root `mcp-description.md`] → it becomes the preamble and shows in the card on the first admin visit; an adoption marker was rejected as the likelier silent failure.
- [A direct push to the git host edits the file] → it appears on the next pull, the same freshness skills and access rules have.
- [A disk fault while reading the file] → the route answers 500, the proxy falls back to the header with a warning, the bridge starts without instructions and logs; absence and failure stay distinguishable.
- [Enterprise wants graph-aware summaries] → the composer is one function; a `CorePorts` seam can wrap it later without touching the transport.

## Migration Plan

Additive. On the first boot after upgrade the startup phase adds `mcp-description.md` to protected branches when missing and adds its `.doorwayignore` rule unless explicitly negated (one commit, like other scaffolding reconciliation). Every new session carries the header and the fixed prefix line. `/api/config` gains a field older bridges ignore; a newer bridge against an older deployment starts normally and sends no instructions. Rollback is a code revert; the file and ignore rule stay in repositories and are harmless. No database change.

## Open Questions

All four were decided in the engineering review of 2026-09-04:

1. **Name and place**: root `mcp-description.md`, read at `${kbDirName}/mcp-description.md`.
2. **Privileged read**: everyone gets the whole text; non-admins cannot open the file under the default root policy.
3. **Editing door**: inline admin form on External agent access, backed by the normal versioned workspace write path.
4. **`start_session` echo**: in `TODOS.md`, gated on the manual eval recorded in this change's PR.

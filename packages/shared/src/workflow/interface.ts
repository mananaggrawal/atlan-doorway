/**

 * locks, change requests as branch-pair reconciliations).
 *
 * Naming convention: methods speak workflow vocabulary (`commitChange`,
 * `openChangeRequest`, `acquireLock`), never git vocabulary (`commit`,
 * `createPr`, no analogue for locks). Implementations may delegate to the
 * existing git/PR/review-workflow services until those are folded into
 * `modules/workflow`; callers should not depend on that fact.

 * Some methods on this interface have no backing service yet — file locks,

 * lands. The interface defines them up-front so consumers can plan against
 * the final surface area.

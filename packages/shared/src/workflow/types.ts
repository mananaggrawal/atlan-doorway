/**
 * Workflow vocabulary — the abstraction our app speaks instead of raw git/gh.
 *
 * Most types here alias existing engineering types in `@atlan-doorway/platform-shared/git/*` so
 * the workflow layer is a single source of truth without duplicating the
 * payload shapes our backend already produces. The point of the aliases is the
 * *name*: callers depend on `Change` / `ChangeRequest` / `Branch`, never on
 * `Commit` / `PullRequest` / `Branch` from the git module. When we eventually
 * collapse `modules/git` and `modules/review-workflow` into `modules/workflow`,
 * the alias targets move with the implementation; the consumer-facing names
 * don't need to.
 *
 * New types that have no git counterpart (file locks, change-request open
 * inputs, conflict-resolution payloads) live here directly.

/**
 * Workflow event bus types — what the backend pushes over SSE to keep the
 * frontend in sync with state changes, including those triggered by other
 * users on the same branch or by the agent acting server-side.
 *
 * **Scope model** — events have one of three scopes, set by the variant:
 *
 *   - **Workspace-scoped** (`workspaceId` field). Pushed to every connected
 *     session whose current focus is `workspaceId`. Examples: a file changed
 *     on this branch, someone took the lock on a file. Anyone editing this
 *     branch cares.
 *
 *   - **User-scoped** (`forUserId` field, no `workspaceId`). Pushed only to
 *     sessions opened by `forUserId`, regardless of their current focus.
 *     Examples: an agent turn called a tool on your behalf, your view should
 *     navigate to a different branch. Other users on the same branch don't
 *     care.
 *
 *   - **Global** (no `workspaceId`, no `forUserId`). Pushed to every
 *     authenticated session. Examples: change requests opening / merging /
 *     being rejected — any user with access to the repo might care.
 *
 * **Identity + replay** — every event carries an `id` (monotonic int) and an
 * ISO `ts`. Clients reconnecting with `Last-Event-ID: <id>` get the buffered
 * tail replayed (server's ring buffer is finite — see `WorkflowEventBus`).
 * If `id` is older than what the buffer still has, the server sends a
 * `{ kind: 'resync' }` instead so the client refetches the world cleanly.
 *
 * **Idempotency over exactly-once** — clients tolerate duplicates and
 * out-of-order delivery: every payload carries enough state for the UI to
 * reach the right end state regardless of how many times it sees the event
 * (e.g. `file-changed` includes the new SHA — UI only refreshes if the open
 * tab's SHA differs).

/**
 * A file's content changed on disk — fires for ANY write that lands bytes
 * for `(workspaceId, branch, path)`, whether or not a commit followed.
 *
 *   - **`newSha` set** → a commit landed. The disk write came through the
 *     full lock-release pipeline (acquire → write → commitFile → push).
 *     History views should refetch.
 *
 *   - **`newSha === null`** → disk bytes changed but no commit yet, i.e.
 *     the writer is mid-edit (lock still held — e.g. the editor's Ctrl+S
 *     autosave-to-disk before the final Save click). Watchers should
 *     refetch content but NOT history (nothing new in git log).

 * Emitted from both the human PUT/PATCH/DELETE routes and the agent's

 * failing — a bad token, an expired one, a revoked repo grant — looks
 * completely healthy from the UI while commits pile up locally, which is
 * exactly how one self-hosted install got 136 commits and two days deep
 * before anyone noticed.
 *
 * `reason` is the sanitised git error, for the log-shaped detail line under

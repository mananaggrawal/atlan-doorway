 * The default branch + the set of protected branch slugs in the KB repo, and
 * their user-visible display names. Single source of truth for BOTH sides of
 * the app, so backend enforcement and frontend affordances can never drift.
 *
 * CONFIGURED, NOT IMPORTED. This module used to read `process.env` at import
 * time and throw when it found nothing — which made the branch model something
 * a deployment had to know before any code could load. On the frontend that
 * meant baking it into the bundle at build time (Vite `define`), so the same
 * artifact could not serve two deployments and changing a branch name meant a
 * rebuild. Both sides now CALL {@link configureBranchModel} during boot:
 * the backend from its environment, the browser from `GET /api/config`.
 *
 * The exported bindings stay bindings — `DEFAULT_BRANCH` is still imported and
 * read exactly as before at every call site. ES module live bindings mean a
 * reader inside a function body sees whatever configuration has been applied by
 * the time it runs. What does NOT work is capturing one at module scope
 * (`const X = DEFAULT_BRANCH` in a file's top level), which snapshots the value
 * at import — before configuration. Use a function there instead.

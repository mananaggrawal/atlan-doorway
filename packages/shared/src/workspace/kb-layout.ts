/**
 * Top-level layout of the KB repo (inside the `KB_DIR_NAME` clone).
 *
 * The repo root holds a small, fixed set of special folders that the app
 * treats distinctly:
 *
 *   <kbDirName>/
 *   ├── KnowledgeBase/   ← all team ontologies live here (the knowledge graph)
 *   ├── Skills/          ← shared skills, organised by ownership; plugins LINK to them
 *   ├── Plugins/         ← one folder per plugin: manifest, MCP servers, tools, links
 *   ├── Data/            ← agent-produced records; parsed like KnowledgeBase/
 *   ├── Agents/          ← .agent files — agent role configurations (not the graph)
 *   ├── Pipelines/       ← .pipeline files — execution-layer processes (not the graph)
 *   ├── roles.yaml       ← identity → role mapping
 *   └── access.md        ← repo-root access-control rules
 *
 * RESERVED IS NOT THE SAME AS CREATED. Core seeds the first two only
 * (`CORE_REQUIRED_DIRS`); `Data/`, `Agents/` and `Pipelines/` scaffold an
 * agentic execution layer that a distribution layers on. Their names stay here
 * regardless, because reserving a name is what stops a KB that HAS the folder
 * from having it treated as ordinary content — the file tree would otherwise
 * fold it into Knowledge as a stray directory.
 *
 * These names are the single source of truth for both sides of the app:
 *  - Backend: the graph parser discovers ontologies under the
 *    {@link ontologyRoots} (`KnowledgeBase/` and `Data/`); `Plugins/`,
 *    `Agents/`, `Pipelines/` (and anything else at the root) are ignored by
 *    parsing, validation, and the diagram.
 *  - Frontend: the file tree renders these root folders as distinct
 *    top-level sections.
 *
 * Don't hard-code these strings elsewhere — import them from here.
 *
 * CONFIGURABLE, WITH DEFAULTS. The three roots a deployment may rename
 * (`KnowledgeBase/`, `Skills/`, `Plugins/`) are `let` bindings applied by
 * {@link configureKbLayout} — the backend from its deployment settings, the
 * browser from `GET /api/config` — the same live-binding pattern as the branch
 * model in `git/protected.ts`. Unlike the branch model they carry defaults, so
 * nothing has to wait for configuration; but the same rule applies: read them
 * inside a function body, never capture one at module scope.
 */

 *

 * `access.md` files — never from the plugins that link it. Plugins point at
 * skills here by path (see `DOORWAY_LINKED_SKILLS_KEY`), so one definition can
 * ship in several plugins, and a skill in no plugin at all is a normal state.

/**

 *   Plugins/<Plugin>/mcp.json                     MCP servers
 *   Plugins/<Plugin>/ai.atlan.doorway/tools/  http + inline `.tool` manuals
 *   Plugins/<Plugin>/access.md                    who can read/write the plugin
 *
 * Each folder is one plugin, laid out per the Agent Plugins specification
 * (https://agent-plugins.org, v1.0.0) so another conformant client can load it:
 * it finds the manifest, the skills and the MCP servers, and ignores everything
 * under the reverse-DNS extension directory.
 *
 * Two parts of a plugin are ours and deliberately outside the portable core:
 *
 *  - `access.md`, which must sit at the PLUGIN ROOT. Access resolution walks
 *    repo root → file directory accumulating rules, so the same file one level
 *    down would govern only that subtree — silently narrowing what it protects.
 *  - `ai.atlan.doorway/tools/*.tool`, the UTCP manuals whose `http` and
 *    `inline` types the spec has no slot for. `mcp`-type manuals are emitted as
 *    real `mcp.json` entries instead, so the portable half stays portable.
 *
 * A plugin's own `access.md` governs what the plugin FOLDER holds: the
 * manifest, the MCP servers, the tools, and any inline skills. Shared skills
 * under `Skills/` are governed by their own scope and are made visible to a
 * plugin's members by granting the plugin's principal (`plugin/<Name>/read`)
 * on the skill — ownership decides, the plugin is a view.
 *
 * A plugin is not a registry of unique names — it is a folder. The same
 * integration may exist in several plugins as separate files (`Everyone/…/
 * notion.tool` and `Finance/…/notion.tool`), each with its own credentials and
 * its own access rule. That duplication is the design, not an accident.
 *
 * The DIRECTORY name is unconstrained by the spec (§4.1 — a plugin is located
 * by path, and the name carries no meaning to a client), so folders keep their
 * display casing. The lowercase slug the spec does constrain lives in the
 * manifest's `name` field.

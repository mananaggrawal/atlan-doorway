/**
 * The join-request naming convention — how "asking to join a plugin" rides on
 * plain change requests with zero new backend state.
 *
 * A join request IS a change request: a draft branch carrying one commit that
 * adds the requester to the plugin's `access.md` body `read:` list, opened
 * against the default branch. What makes it recognisable — to the `Requested`
 * chip, to the manager-side proposals surface, to idempotency — is only this
 * branch-name convention. Both sides (backend, frontend) read it from here so
 * they can never drift.
 *
 *   <email-localpart>/join-<plugin-kebab>-<pluginTag>-<requesterTag>
 *
 * follows the workspace's existing `<email-localpart>/<kebab-slug>` draft
 * convention, so join branches sort with the requester's other drafts and
 * the branch-authorship delete rule applies unchanged.
 *
 * WHY TWO TAGS: the localpart and the kebab slug are both LOSSY, and each
 * loss has its own failure:
 *
 *  - `pluginTag` — over the EXACT plugin name, recomputable by anyone who
 *    knows the plugin. `Finance!` and `finance` share the slug `finance`;
 *    without this tag, listing one plugin's requests would match the other's
 *    branches, read the wrong `access.md` (unchanged on that branch), see an
 *    empty diff and SETTLE the request — closing a change request and
 *    deleting a branch that belong to a different plugin. The settle decision
 *    is "the diff is empty", so plugin identity must be exact BEFORE the diff
 *    is consulted, and `isJoinBranchFor` recomputes this tag to make it so.
 *  - `requesterTag` — over the full email (+ plugin), NOT recomputable by a
 *    reader (a manager listing requests does not know each requester's
 *    email; `isJoinBranchFor` matches its shape only). It exists so
 *    `ali@atlan-doorway.example.com` and `ali@other.com` never share a branch — else
 *    the second requester's commit lands on the first one's branch.
 *
 * The tags are collision-avoidance devices, not a security boundary —
 * nothing grants access based on a branch name. Grants happen through the
 * ordinary access mutation path, and settling only ever closes a request
 * whose file adds nothing over the default branch.

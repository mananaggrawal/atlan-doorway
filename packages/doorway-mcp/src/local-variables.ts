/**
 * Resolving a LOCAL tool's `${VAR}`s from the deployment's Secrets Vault.
 *
 * A local-only `.tool` executes here, on the user's machine, so its credentials
 * have to be here too. Until now they could only come from `process.env` — the
 * MCP client config that launched this process — which meant every person
 * running a local tool hand-placed its credentials on their own laptop, and a
 * rotation had to be repeated everywhere.
 *
 * This closes that gap without widening what a caller can ask for. The request
 * names a MANUAL, never a variable; the deployment re-reads the `.tool` file
 * and resolves exactly what it declares, so the knowledge base is the allowlist
 * and this process cannot extend it. What comes back is bound to that manual's
 * UTCP namespace, which is what keeps one local tool from resolving another's
 * secret — the same per-manual isolation the hosted client relies on.
 *
 * Two limits are deliberate:
 *
 * - **Local manuals only.** A remote manual's tools still execute on the
 *   deployment and resolve their credentials there; asking for them here would
 *   move a secret onto a laptop for no benefit at all.
 * - **Values are never returned to a caller.** They are expanded into a tool
 *   invocation by UTCP's substitutor and go no further. An agent talking to
 *   this server calls `git.push(...)`; it never sees the token that made the
 *   push work.
 *
 * `process.env` remains the last tier underneath this one, so an existing
 * setup that provisions a local tool from the client config keeps working —
 * the vault answer simply arrives first when there is one.

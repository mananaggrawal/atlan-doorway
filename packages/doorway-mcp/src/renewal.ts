/**
 * The ONE renewal mechanism for an OAuth-mode bearer. Three problems, one
 * design, because they are the same problem — "who may run the refresh, and
 * who learns its result":
 *
 *  1. SINGLE-FLIGHT. The refresh token ROTATES on every grant, so two
 *     concurrent renewals are not merely wasteful — the loser presents a
 *     refresh token the winner just retired and gets `invalid_grant`, killing
 *     a perfectly healthy sign-in. Startup does exactly this (`Promise.all`
 *     over two REST reads, both 401ing at once), and mid-run tool calls can
 *     race the same way. So there is ONE in-flight renewal per config; every
 *     caller awaits the same promise and shares its outcome, failure included.
 *
 *  2. PROACTIVE. The REST reads recover from an expired bearer reactively
 *     (401 → renew → retry), but the remote manual's MCP transport does NOT
 *     go through that path — its session captured the bearer as a header at
 *     registration, and when the token expires every remote tool dies until
 *     restart. So each successful exchange schedules the next renewal at
 *     ~80% of the granted lifetime, on an `unref()`d timer that never holds
 *     the process open.
 *
 *  3. NOTIFICATION. A fresh bearer is useless to the remote manual unless
 *     someone re-registers it. `config.onConnectionKeyRenewed` (set by the
 *     server once it exists) is called on EVERY successful renewal — timer- or
 *     401-triggered alike — so the transport swap has exactly one trigger.
 *
 * Key mode never arrives here: `config.renewConnectionKey` is unset, the
 * schedule call refuses to arm, and `renewConnectionKeyNow` is never consulted
 * (deployment.ts's `renewer` returns undefined first).

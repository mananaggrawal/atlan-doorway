/**
 * @atlan-doorway/doorway-mcp — a Doorway workspace as a local MCP server.
 *
 * The hosted endpoint cannot call a tool that only exists on your machine: a
 * `.tool` marked `remote: false` (an MCP server on localhost, an internal HTTP
 * service) is skipped there and only named by `list_local_tools`. This process
 * closes that gap by being where those tools can actually run, while still
 * serving everything the hosted endpoint serves.
 *
 * It does that by registering the deployment's own MCP endpoint as ONE UTCP
 * manual alongside the local-only ones. So the remote tools are not
 * reimplemented here, and — the part that matters — they still EXECUTE on the
 * server: a `.tool` that reaches Notion or a vendor API resolves its `${VAR}`s
 * in the process holding the client, and for those tools that process remains
 * the deployment's, with its Secrets Vault and its completed OAuth sign-ins.
 * Only the local-only tools run here. Their credentials come from the same
 * Secrets Vault, resolved through one narrow route: the request names a
 * MANUAL, never a variable, and the deployment answers with exactly what that
 * manual's `.tool` declares — so the knowledge base is the allowlist and no
 * caller can widen it. What arrives is bound to that manual's namespace and is
 * substituted into a tool invocation; it is never returned to an agent.
 * `process.env` remains the fallback tier underneath, so a tool provisioned
 * the old way (in the MCP client config) keeps working.
 *
 * Normally run as a command (`npx @atlan-doorway/doorway-mcp`); the pieces are
 * exported for embedding it in another process.

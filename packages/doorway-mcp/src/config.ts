  npx @atlan-doorway/doorway-mcp --url <workspace-url> [--key <connection-key>]

Options
  -u, --url      Workspace base URL (or DOORWAY_URL)
  -k, --key      Connection key from External agent access (or DOORWAY_CONNECTION_KEY).
                 With a key the server runs autonomously — the right mode for CI
                 and pipelines. Without one, it signs you in through your browser
                 (needs a deployment at least as new as this package; an older
                 one says so, and a connection key still works there).
      --no-open  Print the sign-in URL instead of opening a browser
                 (or DOORWAY_NO_BROWSER=1) — for a machine with no display
  -h, --help     Show this message
  -v, --version  Print the version

Every tool the hosted endpoint serves is available, plus the local-only tools it
cannot reach. A local-only tool's credentials are resolved from the workspace's
Secrets Vault (set them there, on the Secrets page), with this process's
environment as the fallback for tools provisioned the old way.

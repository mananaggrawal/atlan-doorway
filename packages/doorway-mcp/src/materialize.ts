/**
 * Local materialization of a plugin, per the Agent Plugins runtime contract.
 *
 * A stdio MCP server is a subprocess on THIS machine, and the spec requires
 * its client to provide two real directories: `PLUGIN_ROOT` (the plugin's own
 * files) and `PLUGIN_DATA` (client-managed persistent state), expand exactly
 * those two placeholders in `args` elements, `env` values and `cwd`, and
 * resolve a `./` command against the plugin root — refusing anything that
 * escapes it. None of that is possible against a knowledge base that lives on
 * a server, so the plugin's files are fetched here first, via the deployment's
 * plugin-archive endpoint (key-authenticated, per-file read-ACL'd).
 *
 * Layout: `~/.doorway/plugins/<host>/<plugin>` as PLUGIN_ROOT, refreshed on
 * every server start (a stale copy is the cost of a running session, not of a
 * lifetime) — or, when that root is held by a process a previous instance
 * leaked, a FALLBACK root under the RESERVED sibling namespace
 * `~/.doorway/plugins/<host>/.doorway-fallbacks/<plugin>/<12-hex>` (see
 * `materializePlugin`); `~/.doorway/plugin-data/<host>/<plugin>` as PLUGIN_DATA,
 * created once and NEVER cleared — it is the server's persistent state, and
 * the spec says the client manages its lifetime, not its contents.
 *
 * `.doorway-fallbacks` is a reserved name: no plugin may be called that in any
 * casing (`assertSegment` refuses it, and forbids path separators, so no
 * plugin ever materializes INSIDE a subdirectory either). The reservation is what lets the
 * stale-fallback sweep run inside that namespace ONLY — a legitimate plugin
 * whose folder merely LOOKS like an old-style fallback (`GTM.abcdef123456`)
 * can never be mistaken for one and swept.

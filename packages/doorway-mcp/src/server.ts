 * its credentials here, and the alternative was every user hand-placing them
 * on their own machine. It answers for local manuals only and never returns a
 * value to a caller: what it resolves is substituted into a tool invocation and
 * goes no further. Then `process.env`, unchanged, so an existing setup that
 * provisions a local tool through the MCP client config keeps working.
 *
 * A remote manual's tools still execute on the deployment and resolve their
 * credentials there. Nothing here can reach those — moving a server-side secret
 * onto a laptop would be a wider exposure than the tools it unlocks.

   * deregister (which closes the manual's sessions), re-register with the new
   * bearer, purge the rediscovered remote meta-tool copies.
   *
   * Installed BEFORE discovery: the proactive timer armed at sign-in keeps
   * running through the fetch/materialize/registration work below (a large

   * reads `config.connectionKey`, which renewal.ts already updated — and a

   * holds only names and schemas, and `callToolStreaming` resolves the call
   * template from the repository BY NAME at call time, so re-registration is
   * invisible to it (verified against @utcp/sdk's dispatch).
   *
   * SESSION RECOVERY SHARES THIS GATE. Recovery (below) re-registers a manual
   * too, so both go through `withReregisterGate`: one at a time, never
   * interleaved, and never each waiting on the other. That last part is why
   * `callsParkedForReregister` exists — a call queued at the gate still holds
   * an `inflightCalls` slot, and a swap draining for it would wait out the
   * full deadline for a call that is itself waiting for that swap.

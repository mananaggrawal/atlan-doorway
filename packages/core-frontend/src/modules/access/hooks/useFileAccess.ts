 *
 * `workspacePath` is workspace-relative — the same string the file tree uses
 * (`knowledge-base/Knowledge/Foo.md` for KB files, `my-notes.txt` for a
 * user-owned scratch file at workspace root). `branch` is the branch the
 * user is currently on. The hook splits three cases:
 *
 *   - **Path outside the KB repo dir.** Returns `canWrite: true` with empty
 *     eligible and never hits the network. Files outside `<kbDirName>/` are
 *     the user's own workspace; the access-control tree only governs the KB.
 *   - **Branch is non-protected (a draft).** Returns `canWrite: true` and
 *     never hits the network. Drafts are free-for-all in this model — the
 *     backend doesn't gate commit / push / lock on drafts either; the real
 *     access boundary is the change-request merge against the protected
 *     base. Showing the editor as read-only on a draft would contradict
 *     what the backend would happily accept.
 *   - **Branch is protected (and path is inside the KB).** Strips the
 *     `<kbDirName>/` prefix and queries the backend with the repo-relative
 *     path the resolver expects.
 *
 * Pass `null` for `workspacePath` when no file is open, and `null` for
 * `branch` while the working-tree status is still loading. The hook also
 * returns the no-path state while `kbDirName` is still null (workspace
 * bootstrap in flight) so we don't fire a misclassified request before we
 * know where the repo lives.

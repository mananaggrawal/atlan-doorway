 * everything past the first item or two — "Remove access" included — is cut off
 * at the body's edge, unreachable without scrolling the list out from under the
 * menu.
 *
 * `position: fixed` is the fix, because an overflow ancestor doesn't clip a
 * descendant whose containing block is the viewport. Deliberately NOT a portal:
 * the panel stays inside `Dialog`'s focus trap, which queries its own subtree,
 * so the items remain Tab-reachable. Being fixed, it has to be re-anchored to
 * the trigger's measured rect on scroll and resize — the same shape
 * `BranchSwitcher` uses for its portaled menu — and, because both boxes can
 * change size with the menu still open, whenever either one is resized.
 *
 * The anchor is the panel's own DOM PARENT — i.e. render this where the
 * `absolute` panel used to sit, and it lines up against the same box `absolute`
 * measured. That's not just brevity: a ref passed down from the parent is NOT
 * attached yet when this component's layout effect runs (React attaches refs
 * bottom-up, children first), so the first placement would silently no-op and
 * the panel would stay hidden.
 *
 * Dismissal is the caller's to opt into with `onDismiss`. A menu whose open
 * state is a boolean the caller owns (the verb checklists) has to close on an
 * outside click and on Escape, or it sits open until something inside it is
 * picked — a trap for anyone driving the app from the keyboard, and a surprise
 * for everyone else. That is `useDismissableMenu`'s job, plus one thing the
 * hook's own docstring warns it does NOT do: co-exist with the `Dialog` this
 * menu lives in, which also listens for Escape on `document` and would close
 * itself on the same keypress. Registering the open menu as a modal layer
 * makes it the topmost, so `Dialog` stands down until the menu is gone. The
 * suggestion list leaves `onDismiss` unset: its openness is derived from what
 * is typed, not from a flag a click could clear.

   *
   * This used to be a single "Inherited access (N) — from parent folders &
   * roles" disclosure. That heading names the CONCEPT, which the reader either
   * already understands or is not helped by, and merging every ancestor into
   * one list threw away the only fact that makes an inherited grant
   * actionable: which folder to go and edit.
   *
   * A principal granted by two folders appears under BOTH, deliberately — that
   * is the truth, and it is exactly the case a merged list hides.
   *
   * Rows with no ancestor at all (a role that grants at the workspace level,
   * `manage: 'external'`) have no folder to file under, so they keep a group of
   * their own at the end rather than being dropped.

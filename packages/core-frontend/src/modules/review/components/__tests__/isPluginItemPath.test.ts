 * does not open under the component harness — an earlier attempt to cover this
 * through the UI passed with the guard DELETED, which is worse than no test.
 *
 * The first version of this check shipped broken for exactly the reason the
 * first case below pins: review-session paths are WORKSPACE-relative, so they
 * carry the KB clone as their first segment, and `stripJunkBeforeKbDir` keeps
 * that segment rather than removing it. `pluginOfPath` then saw
 * `knowledge-base` where it wanted `Plugins` and answered `null` for every
 * path — a guard that could never fire.

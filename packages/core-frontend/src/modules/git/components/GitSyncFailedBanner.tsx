/**
 * Shown when a commit landed locally but could not be pushed to the remote.
 *
 * The save itself is fine and is NOT rolled back — the commit is on the
 * server's disk and the retry paths keep running — so this is a warning, not
 * an error state, and nothing here blocks the user. It exists because the
 * failure is otherwise completely invisible: pushes happen behind saves, the
 * one path that does surface an error only reaches a still-mounted editor, and
 * a deployment with a broken git credential therefore looks perfectly healthy
 * while every commit stacks up locally. One self-hosted install ran two days
 * and 136 commits that way.
 *
 * Deliberately not addressed to the author: every cause of a failing push —
 * an expired token, a revoked repo grant, an unreachable host — is an operator
 * concern, and there is nothing the person writing a page can do about it. So
 * the copy tells them their work is safe and points whoever can act at the
 * logs, rather than explaining git.
 *
 * Clears on `git-sync-recovered`, which the backend emits when a push
 * succeeds after failing. No dismiss control, same as `PullNeededBanner`: the
 * condition is real until the server says otherwise, and the next failing save
 * would re-raise it anyway.

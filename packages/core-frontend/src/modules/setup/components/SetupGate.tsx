/**
 * Stands between a signed-in session and the application, and only lets it
 * through once the deployment can reach its knowledge base.
 *
 * WHY IT SITS INSIDE THE AUTH GATE. Setup is not public — it is where a
 * repository URL and an access token are entered. It works on an unconfigured
 * deployment because the bootstrap admin (`ADMIN_EMAIL`) is recognised without
 * consulting `roles.yaml`, so the one person who can finish setup can always
 * sign in even though nothing has been cloned yet.
 *
 * WHY NON-ADMINS GET A DIFFERENT SCREEN RATHER THAN THE APP. Every surface
 * behind here reads from a workspace that cannot exist yet; letting someone in
 * would show them a broken file tree and a stream of failed requests. "Still
 * being set up" is both true and useful, and it does not tell them what is
 * missing — that is the admin's business.
 *
 * A FAILED STATUS CHECK OPENS THE GATE. The check is a guard against an
 * unconfigured deployment, not an authorisation boundary: if it cannot be
 * reached, the app behind it is no less usable than it was, and blocking on a
 * transient network failure would lock everyone out of a working deployment.

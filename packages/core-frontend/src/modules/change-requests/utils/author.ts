/**
 * Who to name as the author of a change request.
 *
 * ONLY `appAuthor` — the app user the backend resolved by matching the hashed
 * identity in the PR body. The `author` field beside it is the GitHub account
 * that physically opened the PR, which is the shared service account
 * (`pr.types.ts`: "Use this in user-facing surfaces — `author.login` is always
 * the shared service account"). In practice `author.login` arrives as an opaque
 * `user-42ee38e1c062`, and `author.name` is the service account's display name,
 * so falling through to either attributes a person's change to the robot or
 * prints a hash where a name belongs.
 *
 * `appAuthor` is absent for PRs opened outside this backend, or when the person
 * has since been removed from the users table. "Someone" is the honest answer
 * to that, and reads correctly in every sentence these surfaces build:
 * "Someone proposed a change", "Waiting on Someone", a byline on its own.
 *
 * BLANK counts as absent, and the trim is not cosmetic. `??` alone lets an
 * empty or whitespace-only name through, which reaches the compare view's
 * blocked banner as "files changed after ⎵ wrote this". Padding is the subtler
 * half: callers take a first name with `split(' ')[0]`, and on `'  Olga'` that
 * yields an empty string from a name that was never empty.

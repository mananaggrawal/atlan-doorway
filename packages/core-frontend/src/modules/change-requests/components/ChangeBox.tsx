 *
 * It sits UNDER the file it is about, rather than in a review queue somewhere
 * else, because the question it asks ("should this text become that text?") is
 * unanswerable without the text. The diff is against the file as it stands now,
 * not against what the author started from: what matters to the person deciding
 * is what would change if they said yes.
 *
 * Two independent states, easily confused:
 *
 *  - `diff === null` means the comparison has not ARRIVED yet — one of the two
 *    file reads is still in flight — and the box says "Loading the change…".
 *    It is never a claim about the change itself; an absent diff is never
 *    rendered as an empty or whole-file one.
 *  - `blocked` means the change cannot LAND: the file moved under it, which git
 *    only reveals when a merge is attempted. It withholds Approve (Decline and
 *    Withdraw stay, since both are still valid answers) because merging a
 *    change written against text that has since moved silently discards
 *    whoever landed first. The box names the fix instead of offering a button
 *    that would do the wrong thing.

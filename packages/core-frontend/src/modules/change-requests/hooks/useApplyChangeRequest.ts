/**
 * Approving a change request, end to end and honestly reported.
 *
 * TWO things this exists to get right, both of which the Library got wrong by
 * calling `mergePullRequest` and awaiting it:
 *
 * 1. **Approving is not merging.** The merge gate requires a recorded per-file
 *    approval from an eligible approver for every markdown file that has
 *    owners — which is precisely the case the skill page is built for, since a
 *    SKILL.md inside a plugin folder inherits that folder's `access.md`. Going
 *    straight to merge is refused with "Waiting on approval for …". So the
 *    owner's click records the approvals FIRST, then merges. Files the caller
 *    is not eligible for are skipped rather than treated as failures: the gate
 *    is the authority on whether what remains is enough, and it reports what is
 *    still outstanding by name.
 *
 * 2. **The merge is asynchronous.** `POST …/merge` acks 202 and runs the merge
 *    in the background, because gate re-validation plus `gh pr merge` can
 *    outlive the gateway's idle timeout. Every conflict, gate block and git
 *    error therefore arrives over the event bus as
 *    `change-request-merge-failed` — NEVER as a rejection of the call. Awaiting
 *    the POST tells you the server agreed to try, and a success message printed
 *    there is a claim nothing has verified. This waits for the outcome, with a
 *    state poll and a timeout behind the event in case the stream drops.

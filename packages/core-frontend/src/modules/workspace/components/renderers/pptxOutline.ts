 * Client-side `.pptx` → text outline, the browser twin of the backend's

 * slides in numeric package order, `<a:p>` paragraphs as lines, `<a:t>` runs
 * concatenated with NO separator (PowerPoint splits runs mid-word on
 * formatting boundaries), XML entities decoded, speaker notes attached to
 * their slide — so what an agent reads through `read_file` and what a human
 * sees in the viewer tell the same story. Implemented independently because
 * the backend module is Node-only (AdmZip, Buffer); this one runs on JSZip in
 * the browser.
 *
 * The XML reading lives in `xmlReading.ts` and is `htmlparser2`, matching the
 * backend's `ooxml-text.ts`. Both were hand-rolled once, on the reasoning that
 * the only question asked is "the character content of `<a:t>` runs, grouped
 * by paragraph". The flaw in that reasoning is that the deck is UPLOADED, so
 * the scan has to be right about every lexical rule of XML rather than the
 * ones PowerPoint's own output exercises — and here it runs on the reader's
 * main thread, which they cannot get back while it spins.

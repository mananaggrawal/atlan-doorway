/**
 * The KB markdown pipeline: the plugin sets and the component overrides that
 * make markdown render the way this app renders knowledge — id-links that
 * navigate, `.md` path links, external links in a new tab, `<details>` blocks
 * as real disclosures, heading anchors, and mermaid fences as diagrams.
 *
 * Extracted from `KbMarkdownView` so a SECOND surface can render with the same
 * rules: the markdown diff viewer, which shows a document as red/green change
 * blocks and until now used bare react-markdown — no id-links, no `<details>`,
 * no mermaid, and no space-escaping in link destinations.
 *
 * Why an extraction and not "the diff viewer renders `<KbMarkdownView>`":
 * `KbMarkdownView` is a whole document view, and three of its properties are
 * actively wrong for a diff.
 *   - It runs `parseFrontmatter` on whatever string it is handed, and that
 *     regex matches ANY text starting with `---`. A diff is rendered in
 *     fragments split at arbitrary change boundaries, so a fragment that opens
 *     on a `---` thematic break would have everything up to the next `---`
 *     silently swallowed into a frontmatter panel. Content disappearing from a
 *     review surface is the worst bug available here.
 *   - It owns a scroller (`flex-1 overflow-auto`), which nested inside the
 *     change-request dialog's and the file-history panel's own scrollers gives
 *     a scroll trap.
 *   - It owns a `prose` scope, which the diff viewer also has — three nested
 *     typography scopes per fragment.
 * So the diff viewer keeps its own block grouping, frontmatter panel and
 * `prose` wrapper, and consumes only the parts below.
 *
 * NAVIGATION IS INJECTED, NEVER LOOKED UP, and so is image resolution. Nothing
 * here calls a hook that needs Git/Workspace context or a Router. That is
 * load-bearing in two directions: it keeps the diff viewer mountable from the
 * enterprise `/embed*`
 * routes, which render outside those providers, and it keeps the existing
 * change-request and file-history tests — which render bare, with no Router —
 * passing without acquiring provider wrappers.

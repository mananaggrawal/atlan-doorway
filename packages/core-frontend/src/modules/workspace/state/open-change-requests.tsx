/**
 * ONE fetch, shared by the tree, the tab strip and the page banner.
 *
 * Three things about this are easy to get wrong, and none of them fails
 * loudly — a degraded change-request signal renders NOTHING, which looks
 * exactly like "there are no open requests".
 *
 * **1. A different endpoint from the dock.** This fetches
 * `listOpenChangeRequests()` — EVERY open request — not the dock's
 * `listPullRequestsForMe()`, which the backend filters to requests you
 * authored or whose paths you can write. That scoping is right for a QUEUE
 * and wrong for a SIGNAL: a colleague's open request on a file you can read
 * but not write would silently get no dot, and the same file would show a
 * change-request marker in the Library and none in Knowledge. The broad
 * endpoint is already on the wire and already consumed by `useLibraryData`
 * for exactly this purpose, so this is parity, not scope creep.
 *
 * **2. Two path spaces.** `touchedNodePaths` is KB-repo-relative
 * (`Knowledge/Foo.md`) — its own docstring says so, because the backend
 * produces it with `git diff --name-only` inside the KB clone. The tree, the
 * tabs and `openFilePath` are workspace-relative and carry the `kbDirName`
 * prefix (`knowledge-base/Knowledge/Foo.md`). A Set built straight from
 * `touchedNodePaths` and tested against tree paths matches ZERO rows. The
 * conversion happens here, once, on ingest — and while `kbDirName` is null we
 * return an EMPTY set rather than one that silently matches nothing.
 *
 * **3. One request, not one per row.** The tree renders this per row and the
 * strip per tab. A plain hook called from each consumer would give every tree
 * row its own request and its own listener, which is why the fetch lives in a
 * provider mounted once.

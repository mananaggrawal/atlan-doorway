/**
 * The review surface for a skill that does not exist yet.
 *
 * A released skill opens its own page, and the change requests against it hang
 * off the file they touch. A PROPOSED skill has neither — there is no page,
 * because there is no skill on the default branch to build one from — so the
 * card opens the change request itself, which is the whole of what there is to
 * read and the only place the decision can be made.
 *
 * `ChangeRequestDialog` needs no adapting for this: it always lists every file
 * the request touches and diffs each against the default branch EXCEPT the
 * ones the request adds, and every file of a new skill is added, so it renders
 * the proposal as one green document and its Apply button records the
 * approvals and merges. No scope either — a scope only ADDS a surface's
 * released files to the list, and a proposal has none by definition.

 * One plugin, as a place: `/skills-and-tools/plugins/:plugin`.
 *
 * A plugin is a KB folder, so this page is the folder made legible — its skills
 * and the tools those skills need, side by side, with who runs it and who it is
 * shared with in one line above them. The sidebar and the gallery could already
 * FILTER to a plugin; what they could not do is be linked to, bookmarked, or
 * handed to somebody. That is the whole difference this page makes.
 *
 * WHICH VIEW: the page decides member-vs-locked, not the router and not the
 * sidebar. The member view renders when the folder verdict says `canRead`, OR
 * when the caller's catalog already contains an item in the plugin (a per-file
 * grant can hand somebody one skill inside a folder they cannot read). Locked
 * means: the summary says no AND the catalog agrees — which can only happen
 * for a DISCOVERABLE plugin, because an undiscoverable one never reaches this
 * page's data at all and renders like one that does not exist.

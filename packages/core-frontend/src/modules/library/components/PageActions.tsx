 * The three actions beside a place's title — the prototype's `spaceActs`

 *
 * Everyone sees all three, and they do the same thing for everyone. That is
 * the whole point of the component existing: the plugin page used to render
 * `canWrite ? "Add skills or tools" : "Propose a skill or tool"` — the same
 * button, in the same spot, opening a different flow with different words
 * depending on who pressed it. In the prototype's words, "the person who
 * taught you the app could not tell you what you would see." Who reviews what
 * is a property of the place, not of the door; the dialog behind `+` says so
 * in its own copy.
 *
 * Weight follows stakes. Share is the one bounded button because it is the
 * only action here with a consequence for other people. `+` is an icon —
 * frequent and reversible. Everything else lives behind `⋯`.
 *
 * No chevron on Share, unlike a Knowledge page: a file can be shared at two
 * scopes (itself, or its folder); a place has exactly one thing to share.

          name, that is the page title, and an answer that covers the heading

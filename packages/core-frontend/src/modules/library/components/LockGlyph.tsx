/**
 * The lock. One shape, three places: the sidebar's count box, the `Locked`
 * badge on a plugin's page, and the all-plugins index rows.
 *
 * Inline rather than an icon-library import because it is drawn ~20px wide in
 * a fixed slot and has to inherit `currentColor` from the row it sits in —
 * a dependency for two paths is a dependency for nothing.
 *
 * `aria-hidden` is NOT an oversight: every caller already carries the word in
 * text or in an `aria-label`/`title` ("Finance (locked)", the `Locked` badge).
 * A named glyph beside a named row would say "locked" twice to a screen reader
 * and once to everyone else.

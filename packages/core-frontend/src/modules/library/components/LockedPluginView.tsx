/**
 * A plugin you cannot read, as a place you can still stand in.
 *
 * Reaching this view means the caller could read the plugin's `access.md`
 * file (the `read: everyone` discovery grant in its frontmatter) but not the
 * folder — the same tier the backend used to include the summary at all. It
 * states four facts and offers one action: the plugin exists, who runs it,
 * how much is in it, and how to ask. Item names and descriptions stay
 * members-only; asking opens a plain change request that the plugin's
 * writers approve by merging.
 *
 * It is the SAME frame as the member view — breadcrumb, h1, run-by lede — so
 * the two never read as different products. Only the middle changes.
 *
 * `Manage access` is the escape hatch for a locked-out platform Admin. Admin
 * rescue applies to WRITING `access.md`, not to reading the folder, so an Admin
 * can genuinely be locked out of a plugin they are nevertheless the right person
 * to unlock. `canWrite` is exactly that verdict, which is why the button hangs
 * off it and not off any role check.

/**
 * One `${VAR}` a tool declares, and the single next action for it.
 *
 * The matrix below is the whole point of this component. A variable is
 * described by five orthogonal-looking flags (`scope`, `oauth`,
 * `adminConfigured`, `userConfigured`, `authorized`/`needsReauth`) plus the
 * caller's `canWrite`, and the naive rendering of that is a row with four
 * competing controls on it. The rules that collapse it to ONE affordance:
 *
 *  - `adminConfigured` is OVERLOADED. On a typed variable it means "a shared
 *    value exists". On an OAuth variable it means "the owner finished the
 *    provider setup" — nothing about the caller's own sign-in. Reading it as
 *    "already handled" on an OAuth row would hide the Sign in button.
 *  - `oauth-auto` NEVER gets a client-secret affordance. Its client was
 *    auto-registered by PKCE dynamic registration and has no secret; saving one
 *    would clobber the discovered provider row and break sign-in for everyone.
 *  - Whose problem is it? A user-scope gap is the caller's to fix and always
 *    shows an action. An admin-scope gap is the OWNER's, so a non-writer sees a
 *    chip that explains the state and no button they can't act on.
 *
 * Secret values are write-only throughout: `type="password"`, held in local
 * state, cleared on save or cancel. Nothing here ever reads a stored value.

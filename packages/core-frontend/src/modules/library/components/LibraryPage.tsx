/**
 * The Library gallery — Everything (the root), Owned by me, and a team's
 * page: plugins as rows, then skills and tools as cards, under one search.
 *
 * This is CONTENT only: the sidebar, the flex shell and the data live in
 * `LibraryLayout` + `LibraryProvider` above it. The filter arrives as a prop
 * because the URL owns selection now — there is no `useState<LibraryFilter>`
 * anywhere, so a deep link, the back button and the sidebar can never disagree
 * about what is selected.
 *
 * Plugins head the page because they are where things live and who they are
 * for; the all-plugins index that used to be the root is this band. A team's
 * page is the same page sliced by the server's answer for that team — what
 * being in the group lets a person use — and never by anything the items
 * themselves claim.
 *
 * Two things it does not have, and won't:
 *
 *  - the LOADOUT. It came from a retired mock; the prototype has no such
 *    concept, and it was a documented client-side stub, so nothing persisted
 *    was lost. Its rail is now the plugin nav.
 *  - Skills / Integrations filter chips. Plugins are the structure, and a plugin
 *    owns its skills AND the tools they need, so splitting the catalog by kind
 *    showed a plugin's integrations detached from the reason they exist.

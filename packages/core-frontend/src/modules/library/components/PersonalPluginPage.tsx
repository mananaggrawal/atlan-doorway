/**
 * A person's own space, as a plugin: `/skills-and-tools/yours`.
 *
 * These are the items in NO plugin folder — the sign-ins that are yours alone
 * and the skills no plugin has adopted. They were a filtered gallery ("Yours
 * alone", a heading and a flat grid); now they get the same page every plugin
 * gets, because from where you stand it is the same kind of thing: a place
 * with your skills and your tools in it.
 *
 * It carries the same actions every plugin page carries, because it is the same
 * kind of thing — with ONE exception, and it is a real one rather than a
 * decision:
 *
 *  - no Share. Every other action here is a client-side affordance, but sharing
 *    needs a folder to write an `access.md` into, and this page is defined as
 *    the items in NO folder. There is nothing to point the dialog at. The
 *    prototype can share its personal list because there it is a real space
 *    record (`mine:<uid>`, proto:2265); the platform has no such object, and a
 *    Share button that opens an editor over nothing is worse than no button.
 *    Giving a person's own items a home folder is a backend change, and until
 *    that exists this stays absent.

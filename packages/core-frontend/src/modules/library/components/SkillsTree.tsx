/**
 * One of the Library's two reserved roots — `Skills/` or `Plugins/` — as a
 * file tree, made of the SAME rows as Knowledge's explorer — right-click menu
 * (new file, new folder, rename, delete, manage access, download), drag to
 * move, drop to upload, the caller's proposed files shown in accent. One tree
 * component in the app, holding a different root.
 *
 * The root is a collapsible folder row named after the folder, exactly as
 * Knowledge and Data are top-level folders in the Knowledge explorer: open
 * by default with its children collapsed under it, a drop target for uploads
 * into the root, the create buttons on hover, the folder's menu on
 * right-click — minus what a platform-owned root must not offer
 * (`FileTreeNode.reserved`: no rename, delete, drag or pin).
 *
 * Two things differ from Knowledge, and both are the surroundings' (see
 * `TreeChrome`), not the rows':
 *
 *  - A click opens the file on its ITEM PAGE, here in Skills & Tools — at
 *    the item's canonical default-branch URL, whatever branch is checked
 *    out. The Library speaks the default branch everywhere; this is no
 *    exception. A skill's SKILL.md opens the skill page; a plugin's
 *    manifest or a loose file opens the plugin page; a tool file opens the
 *    tool page — `WorkspaceItemRoute` decides, from the path alone.
 *  - The current row is the file the URL names, not the pane workspace's
 *    open tab, which the Library never sets.
 *
 * Renders nothing only while the tree is loading. Once it is here the
 * folder is always drawn — empty when the knowledge base has none yet, at
 * the path it will get — because the folder is where new things go, and a
 * person cannot put one there if the way there is not on screen. The
 * reserved root is forced visible by the tree filter even to a reader who
 * may open nothing beneath it, so the row is present for everyone.

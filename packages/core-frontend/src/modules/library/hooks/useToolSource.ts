/**
 * The raw bytes of a tool's definition file, read LAZILY — nothing is asked
 * for until the caller says the source section is open.
 *
 * Why the official version and not the reader's current branch: the tool
 * catalog is resolved against the default branch, so that is the file the
 * platform actually runs AND the file whose read verdict admitted the tool to
 * the page in the first place. Reading any other branch could 404 (or refuse)
 * a file the listing just showed, and would show a draft as if it were live.
 *
 * Access needs no check here. `GET /api/workspace/:id/file` applies the same
 * per-file read rule the tool listing filters on, against the same
 * repo-relative path — so the endpoint is the authority, and a refusal simply
 * lands as the error state.
 *
 * Not `useDefaultBranchFile`, which reads the same file from the same branch:
 * that hook collapses "still reading" and "could not read" into one `null`,
 * because its callers (a diff, an editor seed) render nothing either way. A
 * disclosure must tell them apart — it owes the reader a visible answer when
 * the read fails, and a silent spinner is not one.

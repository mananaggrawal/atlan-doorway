/**
 * Everything one tool page needs, from three independent loads with three
 * different failure postures:
 *
 *  - `GET /api/secrets/tools` is the SPINE. It decides whether the page exists
 *    at all (a tool the caller can't read is simply absent from the response —
 *    fail-closed, and indistinguishable from a typo'd slug on purpose), so its
 *    failure is the only one that becomes `error`.
 *  - `GET /api/tools/:slug` is DECORATION — description + capabilities. It
 *    degrades to `null` on any failure, which is what lets the page ship
 *    against a backend that doesn't serve it yet.
 *  - the skill catalog is the reverse index. It degrades to `[]`, and
 *    `skillsLoaded` exists so the page can tell "no skills use this" from "we
 *    don't know yet" — an empty degraded result must never render as an
 *    empty-state claim.
 *
 * Requests are ordered by a monotonic ref rather than cancelled: a reload while
 * the first round is in flight must not let the earlier answer overwrite the
 * later one, and `slug` can change under the hook when a link inside the page
 * points at another tool.

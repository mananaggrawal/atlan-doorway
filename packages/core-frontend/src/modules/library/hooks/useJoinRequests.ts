/**
 * The join requests one plugin's managers can answer, and the two ways to
 * answer them.
 *
 * ACCEPTING IS A GRANT, NOT A MERGE. A proposal is "give this principal this
 * verb on the plugin folder", so accepting it calls the ordinary access-grant
 * API — the same endpoint the Manage-access dialog uses, with the same gate,
 * lock and commit. The request's branch is never merged, so nothing else it
 * carries can ride in on an approval, and a request naming five people can be
 * answered with two yeses and three ignores.
 *
 * The request then retires ITSELF: it is open exactly while its `access.md`
 * grants something the default branch does not, so once the accepted grant
 * lands the diff is empty and the server closes it and deletes the branch.
 * `reconcile` just asks for that check immediately instead of waiting for the
 * next listing (which does it too).
 *
 * Fetching is unconditional and degrades to `[]` — the endpoint answers `[]`
 * to non-managers rather than 403, so "am I a manager here" stays a question
 * only the server answers.

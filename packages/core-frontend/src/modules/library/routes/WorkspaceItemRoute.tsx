/**
 * The library page behind a canonical workspace URL —
 * `/workspace/<default>/<kbDir>/Plugins/<plugin>/<...>` or
 * `/workspace/<default>/<kbDir>/Skills/<...>` — rendered INSIDE the same
 * `LibraryLayout` route tree as every other library page, so the sidebar is
 * the one the reader already had and nothing remounts on the way in.
 *
 * Resolution is STRUCTURAL, not a catalog lookup: under `Plugins/<plugin>/`, a
 * `*.tool` file is a tool page, the plugin's `mcp.json` is a tool page too
 * (which of its servers is named by `?server=`, or by the catalog when the file
 * declares only one), and everything else — under either root — is a skill
 * FOLDER whose name is the skill's id, resolved by {@link resolveSkillPath}.
 * That is what makes a skill created a moment ago open instantly: its URL
 * says everything the page needs, and `SkillPage` fetches the skill by name
 * itself. Waiting on the catalog here raced every reload and lost (the
 * just-created skill bounced to its plugin's page).
 *
 * The two roots differ only in where a FOLDER that is no skill goes: a
 * container belongs to its plugin page under `Plugins/`; under `Skills/` a
 * scope folder has no page (home). A loose FILE — a folder's `access.md`,
 * a plugin's `plugin.json`, a stray upload — opens as the plain file it is
 * under either root, HERE, inside this app: the same `FileRoute` Knowledge
 * renders, in the Library's own frame. Which app a file opens in follows
 * the folder it is in — the two roots ARE the two apps — never the viewer it
 * needs, so a person reading a plugin's manifest keeps the Skills & Tools nav
 * and switcher around it. (The plugin page was never the file either: it
 * keys on the plugin's identity, which a folder name need not be — a
 * personal space, a folder spelled unlike its manifest — so the old bounce
 * there landed on "doesn't exist" for a file plainly present.)
 *
 * Router state `rawFile` asks for that raw view OUTRIGHT, whatever the URL
 * would otherwise resolve to — the tool page's "Edit the tool file", the
 * plugin page's manifest button. State, not URL: a shared link never carries
 * it, so nobody lands on the editor by accident.
 *
 * The catalog is consulted only to REFINE a tool's slug (a `.tool` may
 * declare an explicit id different from its filename); the filename is the
 * fallback, which is also the default the backend derives.

 * What a path under a root names, by the ONE set of evidence rules both roots

 * `Skills/` itself); `selfName` is that folder's name when it can be a skill
 * (a plugin holding a bare `SKILL.md`), null when it cannot (`Skills/`).
 *
 * THE CATALOG IS THE AUTHORITY on which folder is a skill and what its id
 * is. Folders may nest (`Plugins/Engineering/coding/create-ticket/SKILL.md`),
 * and a skill's id is its frontmatter `id`/`name` — only FALLING BACK to the
 * folder name — so neither the depth nor the id can be read off the URL with
 * certainty. Take the DEEPEST skill whose folder contains this path: a
 * category folder is never itself a skill, so the deepest match is the owner,
 * and a `SKILL.md` bundled inside a skill (`<skill>/examples/SKILL.md`)
 * stays that skill's file instead of inventing a skill called `examples`.
 *
 * Not in the catalog: a `SKILL.md` still names its own skill structurally —
 * the folder holding it — and that is deliberately catalog-FREE, so a skill
 * created a moment ago opens from its URL alone, before any reload lands.
 *
 * Everything below that is decided on POSITIVE evidence only. What the
 * catalog KNOWS is trustworthy whenever it is there — cached entries survive
 * a failed refresh — but what it does NOT know proves nothing: it may be
 * loading, stale (a skill created seconds ago), or have failed outright.
 * Reading absence as "this is not a page" is what bounced valid deep links
 * to the plugin, so this never draws that inference. A folder with catalog
 * skills UNDER it is a container, not a skill — the discriminator between a
 * category and a just-created skill whose reload hasn't landed: the former
 * has known descendants, the latter has none. A FILE is loose when it cannot
 * be a skill's: it sits directly in the root folder (structurally never
 * inside a skill), or its own folder is a known container. A file under an
 * UNKNOWN folder is left alone — that folder is most likely a skill the
 * catalog hasn't caught up with — unless the WORKSPACE TREE, the second
 * witness, has the folder and shows no `SKILL.md` in it: then it is a
 * container (a scope with nothing the caller may read beneath) or a loose
 * file in one, and no catalog can make it a skill. When nothing positive
 * settled it and the catalog is still loading, WAIT: the evidence may be one
 * render away, and guessing flashes a page for a name that is about to
 * change. Only then is the URL read structurally — a file belongs to the
 * folder holding it, a bare folder names itself — and provisionally, so
 * `SkillPage` must not turn a failed lookup into "doesn't exist" until the
 * catalog has answered.

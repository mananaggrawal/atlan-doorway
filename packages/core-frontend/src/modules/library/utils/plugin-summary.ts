 *
 *  1. Expanding a role to its people needs the roster endpoint, which is
 *     admin-gated. A per-person list would render for admins and vanish for
 *     everyone else, so the same plugin would describe itself differently
 *     depending on who asked.
 *  2. Resolution is closeness-first with per-file overrides, so "who can read
 *     this folder" is not well-defined AT folder granularity. A person list
 *     would be false precision.
 *  3. These are the stored truth, and they are what `ManageAccessDialog` shows
 *     the moment a writer opens it — the two surfaces can never disagree.
 *
 * Consequence, accepted and permanent: no "{n} people" anywhere in the Library.

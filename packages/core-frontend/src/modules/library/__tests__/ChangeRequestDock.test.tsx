/**
 * WHICH BAND THE DOCK PAINTS IN.
 *
 * The dock is ambient — it sits beside the skill for as long as you are
 * reading it — and nothing ambient may cover something the user just opened.
 * It shipped at `z-55`, above both the anchored-dropdown band and the modal
 * band, so opening the profile menu got you a list of change requests painted
 * over it and a dialog fared no better.
 *
 * These assert the ORDER against the real components on the other side of it,
 * not the literal number, so raising either band later can't quietly restore
 * the bug.

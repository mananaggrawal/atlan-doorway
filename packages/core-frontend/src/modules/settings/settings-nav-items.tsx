/**
 * The settings rows, and the one merge that orders them.
 *
 * This module exists so the profile dropdown and the settings nav read from
 * ONE list. They are two renderers of the same set — the dropdown is the door,
 * the nav is where you are once you are inside — and two lists would drift the
 * first time somebody added a row to whichever file they had open.
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT live under `modules/workspace`: the design-system
 * parity test walks that directory specifically.
 */

/**
 * The core menu rows. Everything else (Connectors, Watchlist, Routines,
 * Connected apps, feedback, LLM configuration, …) is registry-contributed —
 * see the enterprise shell's `adminMenuItems`. The `order` values interleave
 * the two lists to reproduce the historical row order. In THIS repo the
 * registry is empty (`makeRegistry({})`), so the menu is these six rows and no
 * more; the enterprise app gets all thirteen.
 *
 * Skills & Tools is deliberately NOT here. It is an APP (see `CORE_APPS` in
 * CoreAppShell), and apps belong to the app switcher — which already lists it
 * and marks it as current. Listing it here too made one destination answerable
 * from two different menus, and only one of them could show you were already
 * in it. Do not re-add it.
 *
 * Every core row is DATA: a `path`, not an `onSelect` closure that navigates
 * to one. The closures said the same thing twice — where the row goes, and how
 * to go there — and only the second half was legible to anything that was not
 * a click. The `dialog` and `onSelect` contracts on {@link AdminMenuItem} stay
 * fully supported for registry-contributed rows.

/**
 * The settings surfaces, wrapped in the nav that reaches them.
 *
 * The settings pages used to be reachable ONLY from the profile dropdown,
 * which closes on the way out — so getting from Secrets to Account meant
 * finding a 22px avatar in the far corner and re-summoning a list. The list
 * looked like a nav and behaved like a menu. This makes it a nav: mounted by
 * the route table, so it is a property of being a settings page rather than
 * something each page has to remember to render.
 *
 * It fills the app's ONE `SidebarFrame` — the third renderer of it, after
 * Knowledge's file tree and Skills & Tools' plugin list. `sidebar.ts` already
 * states the claim this relies on: there is one nav, in one place, holding a
 * different list depending on where you are.
 *
 * Three things here are load-bearing and easy to undo by accident:
 *
 *  1. NO `key={pathname}` anywhere. React Router keeps a layout element
 *     mounted across sibling child-route changes, and that is exactly what
 *     makes the nav persistent — the collapse state survives `/secrets` →
 *     `/account`, focus survives the click, and the child page mounts fresh
 *     without the layout blinking. A key here would remount all of it and
 *     reintroduce the bug in a subtler form.
 *
 *  2. `useContext(AdminContext)` directly, never `useAdmin()`. That hook
 *     throws outside `AdminProvider`, and the shell's route tests render
 *     `ShellRoutes` with no providers at all. Reading the context is honest
 *     rather than a dodge: this nav is WAYFINDING, not the security boundary
 *     — the backend gates every roles/accounts endpoint and each admin page
 *     renders its own "Admins only" notice — and no-context reading as "not
 *     an admin" is precisely `AdminProvider`'s own starting state.
 *
 *  3. `<main>` is NOT the scroller, which is the one deliberate departure
 *     from `LibraryLayout`. All six pages below already own a full-height
 *     scrolling container (`PageShell` is `h-full overflow-y-auto`), so
 *     scrolling here too would nest two scrollers and float the scrollbar
 *     off the page's own edge.

/**
 * A row can be shown only if it declares where it goes AND that destination is
 * one of the routes this layout wraps.
 *
 * The first half excludes dialog rows — a dialog has no URL, so it can be
 * neither linked to nor marked current. The second excludes a registry row
 * pointing somewhere else in the app: a settings nav that could navigate you
 * into Knowledge would be a nav that replaces itself mid-click. Neither kind
 * is lost; both keep working in the dropdown, which is the surface that can
 * run arbitrary actions.
 *
 * Module scope, not a closure inside the component: it captures nothing, and
 * as a closure it was a dependency the memos below had to either list (and
 * rebuild on every render) or lie about.
 *
 * The surviving rows come out NORMALIZED, so both halves of the current-row
 * comparison are spelled the same way — the pathname is normalized on its way
 * in, and a registry row that happened to declare `/secrets/` would otherwise
 * render a link that never matches the page it is on.

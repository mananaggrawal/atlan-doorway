/**
 * The settings nav's CONTENTS — a pure view of the URL, in the same sense
 * `PluginsSidebar` is. It holds no state, decides no membership and fetches
 * nothing; the layout works out which rows exist and which one is current,
 * and this renders them.
 *
 * Row styling is `PluginsSidebar`'s declaration token for token, minus the
 * count slot it has no use for, plus `FileExplorer`'s inset focus ring — the
 * more complete of the two treatments. The two sidebars must not read as two
 * products, and the class string is what that rule actually protects.
 *
 * Two things here differ from both existing sidebars, deliberately, and
 * neither is a style choice:
 *
 *  - `<Link>`, not `<button onClick>`. Every row here HAS a URL (that is the
 *    membership rule), so cmd-click, middle-click and copy-link-address all
 *    work — which matters more for settings than for anything else in the app.
 *    The existing sidebars use buttons because their destinations are filter
 *    states and tree nodes reached by callback, not because buttons are the
 *    house style for navigation.
 *  - `aria-current="page"`, not `aria-current={boolean}` (which serialises to
 *    `"true"`). These rows go to pages, and `"page"` is the token for that.
 *
 * No icons, also deliberately: neither existing sidebar shows any, and
 * `AdminMenuItem.icon` is optional — so an icon column would be ragged the
 * moment the enterprise shell contributes a row without one. The icons stay in
 * the dropdown, where a short vertical scan benefits from them.

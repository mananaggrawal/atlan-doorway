/**
 * Deployment settings, routed at `/deployment` — the first-run setup screen
 * given a permanent address.
 *
 * Setup used to be reachable exactly once: the gate showed it while the
 * deployment was unconfigured and never again, so adding single sign-on (or
 * rotating its client secret, or renaming a branch) later meant knowing which
 * environment variable to set and restarting — the very thing the setup
 * screen exists to spare people. The FORM was never the limitation — the
 * backend accepts these writes from any admin at any time — only the door
 * was. This page is that door.
 *
 * It reuses `SetupScreen` whole rather than extracting the SSO half: the
 * knowledge-base connection and branch model are exactly as legitimate to
 * revisit, and one form means the env-lock rule, the connection test and the
 * restart notices cannot drift between first run and later.
 *
 * Admin-gated as presentation only — the backend enforces the same gate on
 * every settings endpoint, and non-admin status responses carry no settings
 * at all.

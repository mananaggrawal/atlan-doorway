/**
 * One button in the top bar's right edge, holding everything about you —
 * the prototype's `.tbme` trigger and `.pmenu` panel (proto:3397-3462).
 *
 * It replaces THREE separate controls that used to sit here in a row: an inert
 * name, a gear, and a sign-out arrow. The prototype's objection is that all
 * three answer the same question — "me, and the settings that follow me" — so
 * splitting them makes you learn three places to look for one thing. The name
 * was the worst of the three: it sat between two buttons looking pressable and
 * did nothing.
 *
 * Order inside the panel is an argument: identity first, so the menu states
 * who you are before it offers to change anything; then the settings anyone
 * has; then the admin-only set; then the way out — destructive last, and the
 * only red thing in it.
 *
 * The prototype's "Viewing as" person-switcher is deliberately absent. It says
 * so itself: "switching person is a demo affordance, not a product one."
 *
 * Open/close mechanics are `useDismissableMenu` (outside click, Escape,
 * focus back to the trigger) rather than the bespoke pair of document
 * listeners this component used to carry.
 *
 * This dropdown is the DOOR into the settings surfaces, not their navigation —
 * they keep their own nav once you are inside (see `SettingsLayout`). Both
 * render the same list from `settings-nav-items`, so they cannot drift. It
 * still lists rows the nav deliberately excludes — dialog rows, and anything
 * the enterprise shell contributes that lives elsewhere in the app — because
 * running arbitrary actions is this surface's job and not the nav's.

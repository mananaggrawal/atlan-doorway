/**
 * The ways an agent connects, named by PRODUCT rather than surface —
 * someone knows which assistant they use before they know which build of it
 * they are in (prototype `AGENT_CLIENTS`). The one exception is the first
 * entry: the LOCAL server leads, because it is the recommended connection for
 * every desktop agent — it serves everything the hosted endpoint does PLUS
 * the plugins' local-only tools — and the entries after it exist for the
 * agents that cannot run a local process (web assistants, cloud platforms).
 *
 * This file is now the welcome page's PICKER and nothing else: which clients
 * to offer, what to call them, and how to say where the snippet goes. The
 * snippets themselves, and the endpoint they are built from, live in
 * `shared/mcp` — which is what makes the welcome page and the External agent
 * access page agree.
 *
 * They did not, before. The docstring here used to claim the two surfaces
 * "can never hand out different URLs" because the settings page derived the
 * endpoint "exactly as" this file did. It never imported this file. It
 * hand-built the same address in six places, and the two agreed by convention
 * rather than by construction — which held only as long as nobody edited
 * either one.

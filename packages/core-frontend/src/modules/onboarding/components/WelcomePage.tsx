 * place, so neither ever replays as blinking.
 *
 * Mounting marks `welcomed`: the auto-redirect here happens on the FIRST
 * sign-in only. The page itself stays reachable forever — the sidebar pill
 * and a typed URL both land here — but the app never drags anyone back.
 *
 * "Done" concludes; it does not copy. A button whose word and act disagree
 * teaches people not to read buttons — the copy lives ON the snippet block,
 * and "Go to your skills →" is the honest exit for someone who leaves
 * without connecting (it ends the redirect, never the pill).

   * redirect starts ENTERED: no hold, no fade, the page simply exists.
   *

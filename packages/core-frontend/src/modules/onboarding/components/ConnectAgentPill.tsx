/**
 * The connect-your-agent reminder — a CTA wearing a nav row's geometry, at
 * the top of the Library sidebar (prototype `.navnudge`).
 *
 * It is the sidebar's ONLY filled accent, which is what makes it a clear
 * call to action, and it stays — across sign-ins, across browsers, because
 * `users.onboarding_done` is a server fact — until exactly two things: the ×
 * or the welcome page's Done. Once either happens the sidebar has no blue in
 * it at all.
 *
 * While you are ON the welcome page it wears the selected state and goes
 * QUIET: held at the hover depth, ring and dot still. A CTA stops calling
 * once you are standing where it points.
 *
 * Dismiss is its OWN button, never the row — clicking "connect" must not be
 * able to mean "never show me this again". One server field backs both
 * endings, so the × concludes the onboarding exactly as Done does; its label
 * says so rather than promising a "later" that will never be offered, and it
 * confirms out loud, because a control that removes itself owes you a word
 * about what just happened.

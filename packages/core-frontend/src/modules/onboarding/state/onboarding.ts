/**
 * The connect-your-agent onboarding, backed by ONE server-side field:
 * `users.onboarding_done`.
 *
 * The pill shows exactly while that field is `false` — across sign-ins,
 * across browsers — and two things end it: the welcome page's Done and the
 * pill's ×. Both call {@link markOnboardingDone}; the write is one-way and
 * idempotent, so neither caller has to know about the other.
 *
 * Only an EXPLICIT `false` counts as "still onboarding". The field is
 * optional on {@link AuthUser} for old fixtures and cached sessions, and an
 * absent field must never resurrect the welcome flow for an account that
 * finished it.
 *
 * Two small client-side pieces around the server truth:
 *
 *  - `doneLocally` — an optimistic session override. The auth context's user
 *    object is a snapshot from sign-in; after POSTing we don't refetch it,
 *    we just remember the answer. A failed POST logs and DROPS the override
 *    at once, so the pill comes back immediately rather than reappearing at
 *    the next sign-in with no account of why it left.
 *  - `welcomed` (localStorage, per account) — "the welcome page was shown
 *    once". The auto-redirect there happens on the FIRST sign-in only;
 *    the pill, not the router, is the standing reminder. Per-browser by
 *    nature, which is fine: being greeted once per new machine is a welcome,
 *    not a bug.

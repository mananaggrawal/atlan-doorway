 * ~3 s backoff. We don't do anything to help it — but we DO re-POST the
 * current focus on every `open` event so the server's session map picks
 * up the desired filter again after a transient drop.
 *
 * **Auth.** EventSource can't set headers, so authentication happens via
 * the `doorway_token` cookie set at login. `withCredentials: true` makes
 * the browser include it. The cookie is HttpOnly + SameSite=Lax, so the
 * frontend can't read it directly — that's fine, the server reads it.

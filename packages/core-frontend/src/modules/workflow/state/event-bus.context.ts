 * Public API of the event bus exposed via React context. Two responsibilities:

 *     event kind. Returns the unsubscribe fn. Multiple handlers per kind
 *     are supported; they all fire in registration order on each event.
 *
 *   - `setFocus(workspaceId)` — tell the backend which workspace's
 *     broadcast events this session wants. Called by hooks that follow
 *     the active branch (typically `useEventBusFocus` driven from
 *     `useWorkspaceState`). Setting `null` clears the focus — the session
 *     stays alive but receives no workspace-scoped events.
 *
 *   - `watchWorkspace(workspaceId)` — ALSO deliver events for a workspace
 *     that isn't the focused one, until the returned release fn is called.
 *     For a page whose content comes from somewhere other than the branch
 *     in the address bar: the skill page renders the default branch's
 *     files while the reader stands on their own suggestion branch, and
 *     without this its images never hear that a teammate replaced one.
 *     Ref-counted, so two components watching the same workspace release
 *     independently.
 *
 * The provider owns one EventSource per tab; this interface intentionally
 * doesn't expose connection state — consumers shouldn't care whether the
 * underlying stream is open, reconnecting, or replaying. If a feature
 * needs to know (e.g. a status banner), we'll add it then.

 *     (`encodeURIComponent(branch)` → `razvan-radulescu%2Fsc`) because
 *     that's what `workspaceIdForBranch` returns and what we put in URLs.
 *   - `event.workspaceId` on incoming events is the URL-DECODED form
 *     (`razvan-radulescu/sc`) because the backend extracts it via
 *     `req.params.id` which Express auto-decodes.
 *
 * Without canonicalisation, every `event.workspaceId !== workspaceId`
 * check silently fails for branches containing a `/` (every feature
 * branch under the `<email-localpart>/<kebab-slug>` convention) — the
 * handler appears subscribed but bails before doing any work, which is
 * exactly what made lock banners / live content refresh look broken
 * on feature branches.

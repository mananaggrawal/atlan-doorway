/**
 * Full-screen "we're updating" screen for backend downtime (Coolify rebuild /
 * container restart). Flow:
 *
 *   1. `authFetch` dispatches API_UNREACHABLE_EVENT when a request fails at
 *      the transport level (network error, or a 502/503/504 from the proxy
 *      in front of a dead upstream).
 *   2. On that signal we confirm via `/api/health` — a single flaky request
 *      must not take over the whole screen. Only a failed probe shows the
 *      overlay.
 *   3. While down, re-probe every HEALTH_POLL_MS. When health comes back the
 *      page reloads so the browser picks up the freshly deployed frontend
 *      bundle instead of running the old one against the new backend. If the
 *      user has unsaved work, FileViewer's `beforeunload` guard makes the
 *      browser ask before the reload discards it.
 *
 * This only covers users with the app already open. A fresh page load during
 * the rebuild is answered by the proxy before our code runs — that error page
 * is Coolify/Traefik configuration, not frontend code (see docs/deploy.md).

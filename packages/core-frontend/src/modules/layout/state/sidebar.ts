 * The app's ONE sidebar: how wide it is, and whether it is showing.

 * that literal — a single `<aside class="side">` (proto:1530) that two
 * renderers fill (proto:2961, proto:3584) — and this store is the platform's
 * version of the same claim. Drag it wider in Knowledge and it is wider in
 * Skills, because it is the same nav in the same place holding a different
 * list. Two independent widths would make switching apps move furniture.
 *
 * It lives in `layout` rather than beside either surface for the same reason
 * `shared/theme/measure.ts` does: the measure belongs to neither.
 *
 * WIDTH persists, COLLAPSED does not, and the split is deliberate. A width is
 * a preference — you set it once because your folder names are long, and
 * having to redo that every morning would be the app forgetting something you
 * told it. Hiding the nav is a "give me the page for a minute" gesture, so a
 * reload brings it back rather than stranding you on a navless app hunting for
 * the button that returns it.

/**
 * How to point an interactive agent at this workspace: the three
 * no-key connection configs, plus the Claude and ChatGPT install links when
 * the deployment is reachable enough for them to work.
 *
 * Its own component rather than a block inside `ExternalAgentAccessPage`
 * because that page fetches external API keys on mount. Testing "does the
 * install button appear" by rendering the whole page meant mocking the
 * credential API first — a test coupled to code it does not care about, which
 * breaks whenever that API changes. This takes a URL and renders; there is
 * nothing to mock.
 *
 * Every URL here comes from the one `mcpUrl` prop. That is the point: the
 * six sites this replaced each rebuilt the address from
 * `window.location.origin`, which is the browser's idea of where we are
 * rather than the deployment's.

 * One click instead of "copy this, open claude.ai, find Settings, find
 * Connectors, find Add custom connector, paste".
 *
 * Anthropic publishes an install link that opens the add-custom-connector
 * dialog with the name and URL prefilled. It only PREFILLS — the person still
 * reviews and confirms, and Claude marks the values as having come from an
 * external link. So this is a shortcut through a menu, not a grant of
 * anything, which is why it needs no warning of its own.
 *
 * It renders nothing when the endpoint cannot possibly be reached from
 * Anthropic's side (see `canDeepLink` — plain http, localhost, private
 * ranges). That is the default configuration, not an edge case, and a bright
 * button that always fails is worse on a first-run screen than no button.
 *
 * `showHint` is for the surface whose audience can DO something about it. On
 * the settings page the reader is plausibly the person holding the env file,
 * so the dead state names the variable to set. On the welcome page the reader
 * is an employee who cannot change deployment config, and telling them about
 * `PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` is noise — they just get the copy-paste URL, which
 * works regardless.

/**
 * Every seam the enterprise overlay can fill in the CORE composition
 * (`createCoreServices`). All fields are optional; each has a safe core-only
 * default, so `createCoreServices(config)` with no ports yields a fully
 * working core deployment.
 *
 * Two consumption patterns exist, and they matter for wiring order:
 *
 * - CONSTRUCTION-TIME ports (`recoveryAgent`, `systemNotice`,
 *   `erasureParticipants`): dereferenced while core services are being
 *   constructed. Enterprise implementations of these need core services that
 *   don't exist yet at that point (the background-agent factory, the thread
 *   service, …), so the enterprise root passes FORWARDING DELEGATORS / a
 *   mutable array here and assigns the real targets right after
 *   `createCoreServices` returns. That is safe because core only *calls* these
 *   ports at request/commit/erasure time, long after boot — the same
 *   late-binding pattern the composition root already uses for e.g. the MCP
 *   OAuth revoke closure.
 *
 * - SERVER-TIME seams (`sessionSink`, `usageMeter`, `authProviders`): only
 *   read when `createCoreServer` mounts routes / registers tools. Core seeds
 *   them onto `CoreServices` from these ports (with the defaults below); the
 *   enterprise root overwrites the `CoreServices` fields (or pushes into the
 *   `authProviders` array) after construction, before the server is built.
 *
 * (Commit-time KB validation and the ontology write block are NOT ports:
 * they are workflow lifecycle HOOKS the enterprise root registers on
 * `workflowService.hooks` after construction — see
 * `modules/workflow/workflow-hooks.ts`.)

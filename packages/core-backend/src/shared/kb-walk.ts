/**
 * THE walk of a knowledge-base checkout.
 *
 * Every reader of the tree — the access resolver looking for rules, plugin
 * discovery looking for manifests, a rename looking for grants, the catalog
 * scanners — used to carry a recursive `readdir` loop of its own, each with
 * its own skip list, its own idea of what an unreadable folder means and its
 * own visiting order. Two loops that disagree on one of those are two
 * answers to "what is in the tree", and every such disagreement was a bug.
 *
 * So there is one loop, and it decides three things once:
 *
 *   - WHAT IS SKIPPED: {@link isSkippedEntry} — dot-entries (`.git`, a parked
 *     delete) and vendored dependencies. Nothing else is pruned; a listener
 *     that stops at a leaf of its own (a skill folder, a plugin folder)
 *     simply ignores what lies beneath it.
 *   - IN WHAT ORDER: each folder's entries in {@link comparePathComponents}
 *     order, so "first by path" means the same thing to every listener.
 *   - WHAT A HOLE IS: a folder that exists but could not be listed is
 *     reported as an event and in the result — never thrown, never silently
 *     skipped — so a reader can show what it saw and a writer can refuse.
 *     A folder that vanished between listing and visiting is not a hole.
 *
 * Listeners see the same events in the same order; what each makes of them
 * is its own business (`.doorwayignore` included — the explorer honours it,
 * the resolver must not, so it is a listener's decision, not the walk's).

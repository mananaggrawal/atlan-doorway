/**
 * Resolve the named ontology a KB path belongs to, or `null` (neutral) when it
 * belongs to none.
 *
 * Classification is deliberately NARROWER than the kb-graph parser: the parser
 * discovers ontologies under every `ONTOLOGY_ROOTS` entry (`KnowledgeBase/`
 * AND `Data/`), but this function classifies ONLY `KnowledgeBase/` paths.
 * `Data/` ontologies are parsed into the graph yet are intentionally NOT
 * classified here, so the session-ontology gate treats `Data/` paths as
 * neutral — pipeline agents read knowledge and write data records in one
 * session (owner decision 2026-07-27; the cross-ontology boundary mechanism
 * itself may be redesigned). This divergence is on purpose, not drift.
 *
 * Within `KnowledgeBase/`, the shape matches the parser (`parser.ts`
 * `walkForOntologies`): an ontology is the directory that holds both a
 * `Knowledge/` and a `NodeTypes/` subfolder. That directory can sit at ANY
 * depth under `KnowledgeBase/`, so the ontology id is the path PREFIX up to
 * (but excluding) the first `Knowledge/` or `NodeTypes/` marker segment — as
 * long as that prefix is inside `KnowledgeBase/` and is not `KnowledgeBase/`
 * itself.
 *
 *   KnowledgeBase/Product/Knowledge/Foo.md            → "KnowledgeBase/Product"
 *   KnowledgeBase/IT Architecture/NodeTypes/T.md      → "KnowledgeBase/IT Architecture"
 *   KnowledgeBase/Group/Sub/Knowledge/x.md            → "KnowledgeBase/Group/Sub"
 *   KnowledgeBase/Knowledge/Foo.md                    → null (marker directly under KB root)
 *   Knowledge/Foo.md, Skills/x.md, access.md          → null (not under KnowledgeBase/)
 *   Data/Ops/Knowledge/x.md                           → null (Data/ is exempt — see above)
 *   KnowledgeBase/Product/Uploads/x.png               → null (no marker segment)
 *
 * Uses exact segment equality (never substring), so `KnowledgeBase/` and
 * `Knowledge-notes.md` are never treated as markers; space-safe; pure (no IO).
 *
 * @param path       repo-root-relative POSIX path (may carry a `kbDirName` prefix)
 * @param kbDirName  optional on-disk clone folder prefix to strip first

/**
 * Workflow domain errors. This is the single source of truth — every error
 * raised by the workflow domain (branches, changes, change requests, access
 * control, locks) lives here. Route handlers shape responses via the
 * `.status` + `.payload` contract on the base class.
 *
 * Lives in `src/shared` (not `modules/workflow`) because the classes are
 * consumed across module boundaries — access, diff, plugins and workspace all
 * catch or raise them — and `src/shared` is the layer with no module imports.
 * Only a type from `@atlan-doorway/platform-shared` comes in; nothing else.
 *
 * Naming: classes use workflow vocabulary. `WorkflowDomainError` is the
 * abstract base; specific subclasses describe the workflow concept that
 * went wrong (`BranchNameError`, `ProtectedBranchError`, etc.). Where a
 * concept is purely git mechanics with no workflow analogue
 * (`NoSharedHistoryError`), the name keeps its git flavour because
 * consumers actually need to discriminate on it.

// `DirtyWorkingTreeError` removed: under save=share + per-branch workspaces
// no operation in the workflow can legitimately encounter a dirty working
// tree. The two former callers (`switchBranch` and `mergeFromOrigin`'s

// internal bug that gets server-side-logged in `statusInternal`, never
// surfaced as a user-facing 409.

/**
 * The local commit landed but pushing it to origin failed because the
 * remote diverged (a teammate or the agent landed competing commits while
 * the lock was held). The cooperative recovery — `pull --rebase` + retry
 * push — also failed, because the divergence touches the same file and the
 * rebase conflicts.
 *
 * Per the "disk is the source of truth" rule we do NOT auto-force-push
 * from the workflow layer (that's a destructive history rewrite that can
 * lose teammate work irrecoverably). Instead we surface this structured
 * error so the frontend can seed an agent prompt — the agent has git + gh
 * CLI access plus the lock-aware write tool, so it can read both sides,
 * semantically merge, and save the resolved file through the normal
 * save=share pipeline. The user sees only a loading indicator; the agent
 * does the reconciliation.
 *
 * State at the moment this fires:
 *   - The local branch has the user's just-committed change as its HEAD.
 *   - The lock has already been released (lock release runs BEFORE the
 *     push attempt). The agent can acquire its own lock.
 *   - `origin/<branch>` has commits the local clone doesn't reach.
 *   - The working tree is clean (the commit landed).
 *
 * The payload carries enough context that the prompt builder can phrase
 * the resolution request to the agent without further server round-trips.

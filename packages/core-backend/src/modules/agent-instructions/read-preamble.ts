 * The raw content of `mcp-description.md` on the default branch, read with
 * PLATFORM privileges: the root is default-deny for reads, and the preamble is
 * a broadcast the admin writes for every connected agent, so it is never read
 * as the caller. `null` only for an ABSENT file (ENOENT); any other failure
 * throws, so a disk fault never masquerades as "no preamble". The workspace is
 * created first when it does not exist yet, exactly as the plugin archive
 * route does.
 *
 * SYMLINKS ARE REFUSED, the same rule the plugin archive applies. This file is
 * read as the platform and sent to every agent, so a link at this name (they
 * only arrive by direct git push; the platform's own write paths never create
 * one) would broadcast whatever the server process can read. `lstat` rejects a
 * link or any non-regular entry before the open, and the open itself uses
 * `O_NOFOLLOW` and reads through the handle it checked, so the bytes sent come
 * from the inode the check passed rather than from a path swapped in between.
 * The rule covers the WHOLE path below the workspace, not only the final
 * component: the repository folder resolved through a link would put a
 * regular file at the name with the link a level up, so the path's realpath
 * must equal the spelled path under the workspace's own — identity, as the
 * archive demands it, not mere containment. (The workspace root may itself
 * sit behind a link — a mounted volume — which is the operator's, not the
 * repository's, and is allowed.)
 *
 * Inside the workspace the repository is the `<kbDirName>/` folder, so the
 * path is `<kbDirName>/mcp-description.md`, the same shape `SkillService` and
 * the archive route use.

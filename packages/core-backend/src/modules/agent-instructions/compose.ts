 * the initialize handshake, which Claude Code, Claude Desktop and Cursor place
 * in the model's system prompt. claude.ai on the web, the Agent SDK and Cline
 * drop that field, so a short prefix is also prepended to the descriptions of

 * the model). Both are capped, because both land in every conversation.
 *

 * file access; the hosted proxy, the agent-facing route and the local bridge
 * all read this one composer's output.

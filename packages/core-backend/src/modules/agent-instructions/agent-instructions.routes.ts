/**
 * The agent-facing instructions route, mounted on the tools router beside
 * `GET /agent/all-tools` and behind the same `manualAuth` (a connection key,
 * an internal token or a browser JWT):
 *
 *   GET /agent/instructions   the composed text both channels are built from,
 *                             as the composer returns it. The local `doorway-mcp`
 *                             bridge reads it at startup; the External agent
 *                             access card reads it to show what agents get.
 *
 * The hosted proxy does NOT call this: it composes in-process at session
 * creation (see `McpService.createSession`). `Cache-Control: no-store`
 * because the text is privileged: it is read with platform rights and may
 * name folders the caller cannot open. A reader throw is a 500, never an
 * empty preamble, so the caller's own fallback decides what to send.

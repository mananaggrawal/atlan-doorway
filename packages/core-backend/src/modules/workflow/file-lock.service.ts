 * Per-(workspace, branch, path) edit lock store. The spec calls for

 * (with an autosave commit) or implicitly by TTL expiry — preventing a
 * disconnected client from holding a file hostage.
 *
 * Lock state lives in Postgres because workspaces share state across
 * backend instances eventually. The hot read path (does someone hold this
 * lock?) is one indexed lookup; the hot write path (heartbeat) is a single
 * row update. We don't bother caching in process memory — the lock table
 * is the source of truth and any cache would lose its purpose the moment
 * a different replica takes over.
 *
 * Stale-lock semantics: `get`, `acquire`, and `heartbeat` all treat a row
 * with `expires_at <= now()` as if the lock didn't exist. We purge it
 * lazily on next access rather than running a sweeper — the row count is
 * bounded by concurrent editors, not history, so lazy GC is fine.

/**
 * In-process event bus that fans workflow state-change events out to
 * subscribed SSE sessions. The shape and scope rules live in
 * `@atlan-doorway/platform-shared/workflow/events.ts` — this module is the runtime that
 * makes them deliverable.
 *
 * **What this owns**
 *
 *   1. **The monotonic event id.** Each `emit` stamps the next id; clients
 *      reconnecting with `Last-Event-ID: <n>` use it to replay everything
 *      they missed.
 *
 *   2. **A per-process ring buffer** of the last `BUFFER_CAPACITY` events.
 *      Replay works if the gap is short. Long disconnects fall back to
 *      `{ kind: 'resync' }` so the client refetches cleanly.
 *
 *   3. **A registry of subscribers**, each owning a per-session push
 *      function. On `emit`, every subscriber that matches the event's scope
 *      (see `isWorkspaceScoped` / `isUserScoped`) gets the event pushed
 *      synchronously to its push callback — the route layer translates that
 *      to an SSE `data:` line.
 *
 * **What this does NOT own**
 *
 *   - Transport (SSE framing, heartbeats): the route layer.
 *   - Auth (which user owns a session): the route layer wires
 *     userId + sessionId in at subscription time, this just stores them.
 *   - Persistence: in-memory only. A server restart resets the id counter
 *     and empties the buffer; clients that reconnect after a restart will
 *     get a `resync` (their stored Last-Event-ID is necessarily older than
 *     the new buffer can serve), which is exactly the right behavior.
 *
 * **Concurrency** — Node is single-threaded for JS, so a synchronous fan-out
 * inside `emit` is safe. Subscribers must not throw from their push
 * callback; we wrap every push in try/catch and log so one bad subscriber
 * never blocks the rest.

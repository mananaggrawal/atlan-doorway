/**
 * Persistent queue of "files written to disk but not yet committed to git."
 *
 * Decouples the lock-release path from git work: `WorkflowService.releaseLock`
 * enqueues a row and returns immediately; the background `PendingCommitsWorker`
 * drains rows by running `commitFile + push`. Persistence is the point — a
 * process crash mid-commit (the bug class that stranded the `GTM/Uploads/*.docx`
 * files) leaves resumable work for the next worker pass instead of an orphan
 * on disk that nobody will ever commit.
 *
 * See `lock-decoupling-plan.md` for the full design context.

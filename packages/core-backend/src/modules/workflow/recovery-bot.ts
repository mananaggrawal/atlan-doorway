/**
 * Synthetic user identity the pending-commits pipeline uses for:
 *
 *   1. The recovery agent's commit authorship — when the background
 *      agent resolves a non-FF conflict and lands a resolution commit,
 *      that commit needs an author. The recovery bot is a stable
 *      attribution that's clearly "the system" rather than any human.
 *   2. The `'system'` feedback notice's `user_id` FK — feedback
 *      submissions reference `users(id)`, so we need a real row.
 *   3. The startup-sweep enqueue of orphaned dirty files — those have
 *      no recoverable original author, and the recovery bot fits the
 *      "this is the system reconciling state" framing.
 *
 * Email convention mirrors the routine-bot pattern (`<role>-bot@<host>`)
 * so admins can tell at a glance what an automation account is for. The
 * `RECOVERY_BOT_EMAIL` env override mirrors `ROUTINE_BOT_EMAIL`.

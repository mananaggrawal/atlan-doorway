   * Close every open change request either of whose branches no longer exists.
   *
   * A change request is a proposal to merge one branch into another, so it
   * needs BOTH. When either is gone — deleted after a manual merge, pruned as
   * abandoned, or left behind by a feature that has itself been removed — the
   * request cannot be read, reviewed, applied or declined. It is not a pending
   * decision, it is a tombstone, and it costs more than tidiness: `listOpenPrs`
   * resolves each open request's changed paths, so every one of these throws
   * `unknown branch` on every poll, filling the log and slowing the list it
   * appears in.
   *
   * The TARGET half is the one that used to be missed, and it was the worse
   * half: a missing source could only ever arrive by a path that also closed
   * the request, while a request whose target had been retired under it was
   * unreadable, undeclinable, undeletable — and invisible here, so it survived
   * every restart.
   *
   * CLOSED, NOT DELETED. The row is evidence — who proposed what, when, and
   * that it was never applied — and it is the only remaining trace once the
   * branch is gone. Closing takes it out of every open list (which is the
   * whole visible problem) while a `state = 'closed'` row can still be read,
   * counted, and reopened by hand. Deleting would make this sweep the one
   * operation in the workflow that destroys history without a human asking.
   *
   * ONE fetch, then a set lookup. The freshness matters more than the cost:
   * `changedPathsForPr` fails when a branch is missing from THAT
   * workspace's refs, which is not the same thing as missing from origin —
   * a clone that never fetched a branch someone else created reports exactly
   * the same error. Closing on that signal would eat live requests. So the
   * verdict comes from `listBranches({ freshFetch: true })`, which fetches
   * with prune and unions local heads with origin's, on a single workspace.
   *
   * Fails SAFE: any error listing branches abandons the sweep entirely rather
   * than closing anything, because "I could not reach origin" and "the branch
   * is gone" are indistinguishable from the inside and only one of them is a
   * reason to act.
   *
   * Returns how many it closed.

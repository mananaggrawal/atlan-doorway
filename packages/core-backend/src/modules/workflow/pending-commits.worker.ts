/**
 * Background worker that drains the `pending_commits` queue: claims a row,

 * deletes the row (success) or schedules a retry (transient failure) or a
 * recovery-agent run (exhausted transient budget). After the
 * recovery-agent ceiling we escalate to a `'system'` feedback notice.
 *
 * Design context: `lock-decoupling-plan.md`.
 *
 * One worker per backend process; we don't currently run multi-replica
 * backends, so a single drain loop is fine. The `claimNext` SQL uses
 * `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` so a future multi-replica deployment can run
 * multiple workers without double-processing rows.
 *
 * Concurrency: at most one commit in flight at a time across all
 * workspaces. We could parallelise across workspaces (different
 * `mutex.run` keys), but the current commit volume is comfortably
 * sequential and the simpler shape catches more potential bugs.

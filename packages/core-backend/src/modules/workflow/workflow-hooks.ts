/**
 * Workflow lifecycle hooks — the generic seam that replaced the
 * constructor-injected KB validator (and the core-owned ontology write block).
 * Core code invokes the hooks at fixed lifecycle points; the modules that OWN
 * the behavior (the enterprise kb/kb-graph modules today) register handlers in
 * the composition root, right after `createCoreServices` returns. Core
 * registers none, so a core-only deployment runs every hook point as a no-op.
 *
 * Two hook kinds with deliberately different failure semantics:
 *
 *   - `commitValidation` — ADVISORY. Runs at commit time in `GitService`
 *     (`commit` / `commitFile`), exactly where the injected `IKbValidator`
 *     used to run. A returned report with `mustFix` entries is logged/surfaced
 *     but NEVER blocks the commit, and a hook that throws is caught and logged
 *     (see CLAUDE.md "Validation is advisory"). The signature mirrors the old
 *     `runValidation(workspaceId)` shape so `KbValidatorService` registers
 *     with a one-line adapter.
 *
 *   - `preWrite` — BLOCKING. Runs before a gated agent write (file-write
 *     tools) or a write-capable shell command; a hook that throws REJECTS the
 *     operation (the error propagates to the tool caller). This is where the
 *     enterprise ontology-session block registers; core registers nothing, so
 *     core never blocks (touch TRACKING stays core — see
 *     `session-ontology.gate.ts`).

/**
 * SSE event-bus HTTP surface.
 *
 *   GET  /api/events?session=<sessionId>     — open the long-lived SSE stream
 *   POST /api/events/:sessionId/focus        — update which workspace this
 *                                              session cares about (changes
 *                                              over the connection's lifetime
 *                                              as the user / agent switches
 *                                              branches)
 *
 * **Why a per-tab session id, not per-workspace** — the connection must
 * survive a workspace re-focus (when the user navigates between branches
 * the URL changes and the workspace bootstrap rebinds `workspaceId`, but
 * the EventSource stays open). So scope = `(userId, sessionId)`; the
 * "what workspace events do I want" state is mutable and lives in the
 * focus endpoint above.
 *
 * **Auth** — the SSE route can't read `Authorization: Bearer …` (the
 * browser's EventSource API can't set headers), so the auth middleware
 * also accepts the JWT from the `doorway_token` cookie set at login. The
 * focus POST goes through the regular auth middleware too, and verifies
 * that the cookie-authed user matches the session's owner.
 *
 * **Reconnect** — the browser's EventSource auto-reconnects on close
 * (~3 s backoff). On reconnect it sends `Last-Event-ID: <n>` and the
 * route replays anything still in the bus's ring buffer; if the buffer
 * has evicted past `n`, the route emits `{ kind: 'resync' }` so the
 * client refetches state from scratch.
 *
 * **Heartbeat** — every 25 s the route writes an SSE comment (`:\n\n`).
 * Keeps proxies (nginx, Coolify's Traefik, Cloudflare) from killing the
 * connection as idle. Cheap (~15 bytes), eliminates a whole class of bug.

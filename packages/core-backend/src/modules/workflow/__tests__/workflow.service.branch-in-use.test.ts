/**
 * A branch is load-bearing for a change request at EITHER end.
 *
 * The regression: merging `X -> main` retired X while a second open request
 * `Y -> X` still proposed INTO it. Every guard asked only "is X anybody's
 * SOURCE?", so X was deleted and `Y -> X` became permanently unusable — it
 * could not be read (the detail read resolves the target first), declined, or
 * deleted, and the boot sweep looked at sources only, so it survived every
 * restart.
 *
 * These tests run the REAL drizzle query against seeded rows (via the pg-proxy
 * driver, which hands the generated SQL and its parameters to a callback)
 * rather than a stub that answers by call order. That is deliberate: a mock
 * blind to the `where` clause returns the same row whether the guard asks
 * about one branch end or both, so it would pass just as happily against the
 * source-only code this fixes — it could not detect the regression it exists
 * for. Here, reverting `openChangeRequestOn` to a source-only lookup makes the
 * seeded `Y -> X` row stop matching, and these tests fail.

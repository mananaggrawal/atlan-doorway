/**
 * Ontology-session boundary — the PURE decision core (no IO, no DB).
 *
 * Model: each run/session accumulates the SET of named ontologies it has
 * touched (via any read or write). The rule is asymmetric:
 *
 *   READS  — always allowed. A read that touches a named ontology RECORDS it
 *            into the session's touched set (so it can poison later writes).
 *   WRITES — allowed only while the session is confined to a SINGLE named
 *            ontology and the write targets that same ontology. The moment a
 *            session has touched two or more named ontologies (typically by
 *            reading across them), EVERY subsequent write is blocked — "read
 *            across ontologies → you can't write anymore at all."
 *
 * Neutral touches (`ontologyOf` → null: root config, Skills, root-level
 * Knowledge, non-KB) never record and never block. See
 * `docs/rp4-ontology-boundary-plan-v2.md`.
 *
 * `SessionOntologyService` (Postgres-backed) persists the touched set and calls
 * these helpers; this module keeps the rule itself testable in isolation.

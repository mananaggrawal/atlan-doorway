/**
 * One gate for an endpoint that serves the app AND agents: a bearer that
 * looks like a tool credential (a `doorway_…` connection key, an internal
 * token) goes through the tool-auth middleware; anything else — the
 * browser's session JWT, its cookie — goes through the session middleware.
 * Whichever admitted the caller, `req.userId` names them afterwards, so a
 * handler written for sessions (`resolveUser` → `req.userId`) serves both.
 *
 * Composition, not a third verifier: each credential is still checked by
 * the code that owns it. Deliberately NOT the read-only-manuals gate
 * (`createManualAuthMiddleware`), which is documented as the one place a
 * session may stand in for a tool credential; here it is the other way
 * round — a tool credential is admitted to an app endpoint — and only for
 * endpoints a tool definition describes.

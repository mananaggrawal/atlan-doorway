 * manages that is whether the skill's own access rules name the plugin's
 * `plugin/<Name>/read` principal — the link service writes that grant with
 * the link, so `false` means a hand edit took it away. A link read from an
 * external plugin format needs no grant (the skill's own scope decides who

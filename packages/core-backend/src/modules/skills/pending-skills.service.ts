/**
 * Skills that exist only on an open change request — proposed, not released.
 *
 * The catalog (`SkillService`) is pinned to the default branch, which is the
 * right answer for everything that LOADS a skill and the wrong one for the
 * person who just proposed it: a change request that ADDS a skill folder has
 * nothing on the default branch to hang itself off, so until it merged the
 * proposal was invisible to its author and to the people who had to approve it.
 * This service is that missing half, and it is deliberately a separate surface
 * rather than a widening of the catalog — an unapproved skill must never become
 * loadable just because it became visible.
 *
 * WHO MAY SEE ONE is narrower than who may see the catalog: the author, and
 * whoever could approve it. "Could approve it" is not re-stated here as a
 * plugin-admin check — it is `canWrite` on the SKILL.md the request would
 * create. The new folder carries no `access.md` of its own, so that verdict
 * inherits from the plugin folder, which IS the plugin's admin; asking the access
 * tree keeps this surface and the merge gate answering with one voice, and it
 * keeps working for skills nested in a category subfolder that carries rules of
 * its own.
 *
 * Everything degrades to "nothing pending" rather than throwing: this hangs off
 * the library's list load, and a review surface that cannot answer must not
 * take the shelf down with it.

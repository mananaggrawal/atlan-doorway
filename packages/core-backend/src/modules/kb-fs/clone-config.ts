/**
 * The git configuration a per-branch workspace clone must carry: the tracking
 * config that pins its branch to exactly ONE upstream ref, and the credential
 * helper its remote operations authenticate with.
 *
 * Both are stamped at clone time AND re-stamped when an existing clone is
 * adopted from disk, so a clone created by an older build — or by a path that
 * only authenticated its own invocation — is repaired rather than left broken.
 *
 * On the tracking half:
 *
 * Why this exists: a clone's config is append-only from git's point of view,
 * and several things write to it:
 *
 *   - `git config --add branch.<name>.merge …` / `git branch --set-upstream-to`
 *     run out of band (an agent shell session in the workspace, a manual fix)
 *     leaves a SECOND `branch.<name>.merge` value;
 *   - `git remote set-branches --add origin …`, a re-run `git remote add`, or a
 *     hand-edited `.git/config` leaves a SECOND `remote.origin.fetch` refspec,
 *     so one fetch maps the same remote branch in twice.
 *
 * A multi-valued `branch.<name>.merge` is what makes a BARE `git fetch origin`
 * write more than one *for-merge* entry into the clone's shared
 * `.git/FETCH_HEAD` — git adds one per configured merge ref. That is the
 * ammunition behind the reported failure: `git pull` reads its rebase target
 * out of that same shared file, so when one of the app's unmutexed bare
 * fetches lands inside the pull's fetch→read window, the pull sees two merge
 * heads and dies with `fatal: Cannot rebase onto multiple branches.`
 *
 * The drift alone is NOT sufficient — an explicit `git pull --rebase origin
 * <branch>` survives every drift shape on its own (verified across the shapes
 * above on git 2.39.5); it takes the concurrent fetch too. `GitService.pull`
 * closes the other half by never reading or writing FETCH_HEAD; normalising
 * the config here removes the ammunition.
 *
 * These are the three keys that pin the clone back to "this branch tracks
 * `origin/<branch>`, nothing else"; applied with `--replace-all` they collapse
 * any accumulated duplicates into one value.
 *
 * Lives here — next to `assertValidBranchName` — as a leaf-level primitive
 * shared by the git layer (self-heal before every pull) and `WorkspaceService`
 * (stamped on new clones, and re-stamped on existing ones the first time this
 * process opens them, which is the migration for clones already on disk).

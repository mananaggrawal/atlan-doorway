/**
 * One in-process notification fired AFTER a set of file changes is committed +
 * pushed (post-lock-release), so backend services can react to KB writes without
 * the per-file TTL wait. Distinct from the SSE `WorkflowEventBus`, which fans
 * scoped events to browser sessions; this is an unscoped, server-side domain hook.
 *
 * BATCHED by design: a single-file save emits `paths: [p]`, a batch write
 * (`LockingFilesystem.writeFiles`, e.g. a bulk node upload) emits ONE event with
 * every path it committed. Subscribers that do expensive per-event work (the
 * id-repair rebuilds the id index) handle a whole batch off one rebuild instead
 * of N back-to-back ones.
 *
 * Emitted from the two post-commit chokepoints (`WorkflowService.runPendingCommit`
 * for single-file writes, `LockingFilesystem.writeFiles` for batches).
 *
 * Every listener is invoked inside try/catch — a throwing subscriber must never
 * fail the commit that triggered it (mirrors the SSE bus's per-subscriber
 * isolation). Firing is fire-and-forget; a listener that needs to write files
 * (id-repair) does so on its own, after the locks have already been released.

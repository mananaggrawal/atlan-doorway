/**
 * A `LocalFilesystem` that wraps every mutating operation in a workflow
 * lock acquire → super-call → release-with-auto-commit-and-push cycle.
 * This is the agent's file edit surface — Mastra hands the agent the
 * workspace's filesystem tools (write_file / edit_file / etc.), and those
 * call directly into this class, so the agent's edits go through the same
 * lock + commit + push pipeline as the human editor's saves.
 *
 * Per the workflow spec (PLAN.md §2):
 *   - Each tool call is one acquire/release cycle. The agent never holds a
 *     lock while it's "thinking" between tool calls — a fast human editor
 *     can always grab a file the agent isn't actively writing.
 *   - On lock contention (someone else holds the lock) we retry 3× at
 *     2-second intervals (~6s ceiling) then surface a structured error
 *     so the agent can skip the file and continue with the rest of its
 *     turn rather than aborting the whole call.
 *   - Lock-release inside `WorkflowService.releaseLock` is the thing that
 *     actually commits + pushes the file — see that method for the
 *     `commitFile → release → push` sequence. We don't repeat the commit
 *     step here; releasing IS committing.
 *   - `rmdir` is refused. The workflow invariant is "each change touches
 *     exactly one file" and a recursive directory delete violates that.
 *     The agent must delete entries individually via `deleteFile`.
 *   - `mkdir` followed by a `.gitkeep` write is the canonical way to land
 *     "create empty folder" as a one-file change — the locking write of
 *     `.gitkeep` carries the commit.
 *
 * Path conventions: Mastra's `inputPath` is workspace-relative (e.g.
 * `knowledge-base/Knowledge/Foo.md`) — the same shape the human
 * editor's `openFilePath` carries, so locks acquired by the agent and
 * the user collide on the same key. That's why the human can't sneak
 * an edit in while the agent is writing the same file.

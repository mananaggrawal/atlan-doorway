/**
 * The ONLY core route that returns secret VALUES.
 *
 * Everywhere else a credential is resolved in-process at tool-call time and
 * never crosses the wire — `resolve()` has one caller, the UTCP variable
 * loader. One runtime outside this process legitimately needs values anyway:
 * the LOCAL MCP server, which executes a `remote: false` `.tool` on the user's
 * own machine and has to expand that manual's `${VAR}` refs there.
 *
 * The discipline that makes this safe, and the reason it is a narrow route
 * rather than a generic "resolve these keys" endpoint: **the caller never names
 * the variables**. It names a knowledge-base file; the server re-reads that
 * file from the DEFAULT branch and resolves exactly what the file declares.
 * The knowledge base is the allowlist, it is reviewable as a diff, and no
 * caller — however privileged its connection key — can widen it.
 *
 * Three further constraints hold here:
 *
 * 1. **Read access is required.** A caller that cannot read the declaring file
 *    gets a 404, not an empty object: whether a manual exists is itself
 *    information.
 * 2. **Only local manuals.** A remote-capable `.tool`'s credentials are used
 *    server-side; handing them to a local caller would egress a secret that had
 *    no reason to leave.
 * 3. **Values are never logged, only names.** Every resolve emits one audit
 *    line naming the caller, the file and the variable names — enough to
 *    reconstruct who was handed what, and never the what itself.
 *
 * Responses are `no-store`: a secret must not sit in an intermediary cache.
 *
 * An overlay that ships its own kind of declaring file adds its own route in
 * this same shape rather than widening this one. The allowlist has to be a file
 * the server itself reads, and a route that understood several file kinds would
 * be one refactor away from taking the list from the caller.

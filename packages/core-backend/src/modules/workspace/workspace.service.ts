   * cache key, the encoded form is the disk directory name.
   *
   * Resolution order:
   *   1. In-process cache (`branchDirs`) — bootstrap completed earlier this
   *      run, or a prior `resolveWorkspaceDir` populated it from disk.
   *   2. On-disk lookup — the directory may persist across container
   *      restarts; if `<id>/<kbDirName>/.git` is there, register and return.
   *   3. **Lazy bootstrap** — clone the branch on demand via
   *      `getOrCreateForBranch`. Without this, any frontend route that
   *      hits `/api/workspace/:id/workflow/...` for a branch the user
   *      hasn't explicitly bootstrapped via `GET /api/workspace?branch=…`
   *      would 500 with "Invalid workspace ID" (real symptom in dev:
   *      `listBranches` / `branch-status` failing right after container
   *      start because the frontend's parallel calls race the initial
   *      bootstrap). Bootstrap is single-flight so concurrent racers
   *      share one clone. A bogus branch name surfaces the underlying
   *      `BranchNameError` / clone failure verbatim — much more useful
   *      than the old generic "Invalid workspace ID".
   *
   * Cold-cache cost: a mid-request clone is multi-second. Subsequent
   * requests use the cache. Acceptable since it only happens once per
   * branch per container lifetime.

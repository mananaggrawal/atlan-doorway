 * store's — sits BESIDE the workspaces root, never inside a workspace and
 * never committed.
 *
 * Bounding: writes best-effort prune OLDEST-MTIME entries until the total
 * size fits `maxTotalBytes` (simple LRU-ish eviction; reads don't touch
 * mtime, so it is closer to FIFO — good enough for a cache whose entries are
 * cheap to rebuild). The full scan is deferred until the writes since the
 * last one could plausibly have reached the bound (see `writtenSinceScan`).
 * Every filesystem error here is swallowed: the cache is an accelerator,

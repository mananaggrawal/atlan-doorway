 * The extractors turn an office document (`.docx` / `.pptx` / `.xlsx`), an
 * OpenDocument file (`.odt` / `.odp` / `.ods`) or a PDF into plain text an
 * agent can read and grep. They are HONEST about being
 * lossy: every successful extraction carries a one-line `summary` the consumer
 * turns into a marker header (`[extracted text of <path> — <summary>]`) so the
 * reader knows it is looking at extracted text, not the file's bytes.
 *
 * The `summary` (not a full marker) is what extractors return and what the
 * cache stores, because the cache is keyed by CONTENT (git blob sha): the same
 * document at two workspace paths shares one cache entry, and baking a path
 * into the cached value would surface the wrong path on the second read.

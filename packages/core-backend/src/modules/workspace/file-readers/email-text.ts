/**
 * Shared shaping for the email extractors (`extract-eml.ts` / `extract-msg.ts`).
 *
 * Both formats extract to the SAME text shape, so an agent greps a mailbox
 * without caring which client saved the file:
 *
 *   [from] Ada Lovelace <ada@example.com>
 *   [to] Bob <bob@example.com>, carol@example.com
 *   [subject] Quarterly numbers
 *   [date] 2026-01-05T10:00:00.000Z
 *
 *   the body…
 *
 *   [attachments]
 *   report.pdf (application/pdf, 48211 bytes)
 *
 * Header lines are omitted when the message lacks the field (never printed
 * empty). The body prefers the plain-text part; an HTML-only body is stripped
 * to text (block tags become newlines so paragraphs survive) and the marker
 * summary says so. Attachments are LISTED by name only — v1 does not extract
 * inside them, and the summary says that too.

 * Strip an HTML email body to plain text. Deliberately simple (the same

 * `<title>` containers are dropped whole, `<br>` and block-level tag
 * boundaries become newlines so paragraphs survive, every other tag is
 * removed, and entities are decoded through the module's shared
 * `decodeXmlEntities` (plus `&nbsp;`, which HTML has and XML does not). Runs
 * of blank lines collapse to one.
 *
 * Implemented as a SINGLE-PASS linear scanner, not regexes: the earlier
 * quote-aware tag regexes re-scanned the remaining body from every `<` when a
 * quoted attribute never closed — malformed input with many `<` characters
 * plus one unterminated quote pinned the server quadratically. The scanner is
 * quote-aware the same way (a `>` INSIDE a quoted attribute value, as in
 * `<a title="a > b">`, never ends the tag early) but amortizes the failures:
 * a scan that reaches end-of-input marks every `<` it passed OUTSIDE quotes
 * as known-literal (their scans would be identical tails), so no position is
 * rescanned from more than the three possible quote states. An unterminated
 * tag is literal text, not a tag — and so is a `<…>` span that names no
 * element at all, which is how `1 < 2 > 0` survives into the body.

/**

 * order, against lazily-cloned branch handles, then land one commit per
 * dirty branch. Invoked at the deployment's two quiet moments — boot (before
 * routes mount) and first-time setup completion (the app is gated shut until
 * then) — and never again while the process serves.
 *
 * Fully fail-closed: any failure this phase cannot DECLARE (an unhandled
 * step throw, an unreachable remote, a clone that will not come down, a
 * refused write) throws out of `runAll` and stops the boot. The container's
 * restart policy is the retry — each attempt at boot time on quiet trees —
 * so an environmental failure converges without a human the moment the
 * environment returns. The one carve-out: a push rejected because a
 * concurrent replica won rolls back and continues; the winner already landed
 * the same idempotent changes, and stopping the loser would make every
 * multi-replica deploy flappy by design.
 *
 * `KB_SAFE_BOOT=1` is the break-glass demotion: on the first failure the
 * phase resets every uncommitted tree, abandons the rest of the phase, and
 * lets the server boot UNMAINTAINED so an admin can get in and rescue —
 * loudly, at boot and in the log, because an env var outlives the emergency.

/**
 * Give every legacy plugin folder its manifest, as an {@link OnServerStart}
 * step.
 *
 * A plugin IS a folder carrying `plugin.json` (or a `plugin.bundle.json`, the
 * read-only customer dialect) — discovery reads nothing else, at any depth.
 * Folders from before the manifest existed have `access.md`, an `mcp.json`,
 * a `skills/` tree or `.tool` manuals and no `plugin.json` beside them; the
 * old scanners read those by position (directly under the plugins root),
 * and this step is what retires that rule: it writes the minimal manifest
 * into each such folder, once, so the position never has to mean anything
 * again.
 *
 * WHICH folders: walk the plugins root; a folder holding either file is a
 * plugin and is not entered. Any other folder is entered first. A folder
 * DIRECTLY under the root — the only place the legacy layout ever put a
 * plugin — becomes one when nothing plugin-shaped lives beneath it and its
 * own content is legacy content: a scope folder (the dialect's
 * `plugins/functional/…`) can carry an `access.md` of its own and must stay
 * a scope, and a skill folder inside a legacy plugin must not become a
 * plugin of its own. "Legacy content" is the set of things provisioning and
 * the old migration ever put in a plugin folder: `access.md`, `mcp.json`,
 * `skills/`, the doorway extension directory, a `.tool` file, or a `SKILL.md`
 * anywhere beneath (the pre-`skills/` shape).
 *
 * Every branch, drafts included, like the Groups→Plugins migration and for
 * the same reason: a draft migrated alongside its target diffs by the user's
 * own changes only. Idempotent: a folder that has its manifest is skipped.

/**
 * One-way migration of a knowledge base from `Groups/` to the Agent Plugins
 * layout under `Plugins/` (https://agent-plugins.org, v1.0.0), as an
 * {@link OnServerStart} step. (It began life as an in-place module run from
 * the lazy top-up; that path is gone, and this is the only form.) Steps
 * never write: every change is DECLARED on the branch handle
 * (`move`/`write`/`remove`) and the runner applies it, while every read goes
 * against the real, pre-step tree via `repoDir()`.
 *
 * Idempotent: a KB already on the new layout is untouched, and a half-finished
 * run is completed by the next one.
 *
 * What moves — and what CONVERTS:
 *
 *   Groups/GTM/access.md            → Plugins/GTM/access.md            (stays put)
 *   Groups/GTM/deploy/SKILL.md      → Plugins/GTM/skills/deploy/SKILL.md
 *   Groups/GTM/web-search.tool      → Plugins/GTM/ai.atlan.doorway/tools/web-search.tool
 *   Groups/GTM/notion.tool (mcp)    → an entry in Plugins/GTM/mcp.json, and the
 *                                     `.tool` file is DELETED — mcp.json is
 *                                     authoritative for MCP servers now.
 *                                     Plugins/GTM/plugin.json           (written)
 *
 * The mcp.json entry is keyed by the `.tool`'s manual id: that id is the
 * namespace vault secrets bind to (`<id>_<VAR>`), so keeping it is what keeps
 * every configured secret and completed OAuth grant bound. What mcp.json
 * cannot carry — auth headers with `${VAR}` references, variable declarations,
 * the local-only flag — moves into `plugin.json`'s
 * `extensions["ai.atlan.doorway"].mcpServers[<id>]` block, the reverse-DNS
 * namespace the spec reserves for client-specific data. `http`/`inline`
 * manuals still MOVE as `.tool` files: nothing but this platform can run them.
 *
 * Scope: EVERY branch, drafts included and writable (`ctx.allBranches()`) —
 * maintenance applied uniformly at the quiet moment is what keeps a draft's
 * change-request diff down to the user's own changes; a stale draft against a
 * migrated target would diff by the whole rename.
 *
 * Outcomes: a per-manual NOT-converted refusal makes the step `partial` with
 * the reasons (the declared ops for everything else still apply); a branch
 * carrying BOTH roots contributes nothing but a note; everything else is `ok`.

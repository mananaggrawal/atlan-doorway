/**
 * Keep every personal space closed to everyone but its owner — Admin
 * included — and let its access.md say so in both blocks.
 *
 * A personal folder's access.md used to be seeded with the owner's grants
 * alone. That is private only while nothing above it grants read — and the
 * usual way an administrator opens a knowledge base up is `read: everyone`
 * at the repository root, which then reached into every person's private
 * space. Personal folders seeded since deny `everyone` read outright; this
 * step gives the ones seeded before the same rule, on every branch, on the
 * next start. The file's own block gets the same statement (`deny
 * everyone` and the people the folder admits) where it used to say nothing
 * (`read: []`), so the file reads as what it is — see `isPrivateAccessMd`.
 *
 * A SPLICE, not a rewrite: the denial is added to the folder's read rules
 * (and, for the old seed's shape, the owner's grants are carried into
 * the folder's rules — see {@link closePersonalSpaceRules}); every other
 * byte — anyone the owner added, comments — stays. Idempotent: a folder
 * whose rules already deny `everyone` is left alone, so a person who removed
 * the denial on purpose would get it back once, on the upgrade that
 * introduces it, and not again.
 * Files that do not parse are the operator's to fix and are skipped.

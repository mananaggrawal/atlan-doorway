 * An explicit `!pattern` line also returns the text unchanged: that is the
 * operator choosing to SHOW the file, and ordered matching means a positive
 * line appended after it would win and silently defeat the choice. Hiding
 * the conventions doc is a default this provides, never a mandate.
 *
 * The preamble rule reads its unanchored spelling the same way. By the time
 * this runs, the platform's OWN legacy line has been respelled (see
 * {@link withPlatformIgnorePatternRespelled}), so a bare `mcp-description.md`
 * still standing here is the operator's: it already hides the file, and
 * appending the anchored rule beside it would say nothing they have not.

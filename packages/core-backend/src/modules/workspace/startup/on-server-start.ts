/**
 * The KB startup contract: every migration and scaffolding concern runs here,
 * at the deployment's quiet moments, and nowhere else.
 *
 * There are exactly two occasions, both provably quiet (no user holds a lock,
 * no edit is mid-flight): SERVER BOOT, before routes mount; and FIRST-TIME
 * SETUP COMPLETION, when the branch model is configured through the setup
 * screen — the app is gated shut until exactly that moment. Any later re-run
 * would race live sessions on the very working clones it maintains, which is
 * why there is no retry tick, no lazy per-branch trigger, and no maintenance
 * on runtime branch opens, ever. A failed boot is retried by the container's
 * restart policy — each attempt at boot time, on quiet trees.
 *
 * Failure model, fully fail-closed: the server either completes the phase or
 * does not serve. An UNHANDLED throw from a step stops the boot — the same
 * contract a DB migration has. A failure the author knows is survivable must
 * be DECLARED via the result. `KB_SAFE_BOOT=1` is the break-glass demotion
 * (see the runner).

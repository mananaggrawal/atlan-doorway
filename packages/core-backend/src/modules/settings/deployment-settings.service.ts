 *
 * Values are cached in memory after {@link load}. Reads happen on every clone
 * and every git call, and a database round-trip there would be a tax on the
 * hot path for data that changes about twice in a deployment's life.
 *
 * WHICH MAKES THE CACHE PER-PROCESS, and that is a real constraint rather than
 * an oversight: a second replica keeps serving what it read at boot until it
 * restarts. It is acceptable here only because of what these settings are —
 * the knowledge-base connection, written once during first-run setup, on a
 * deployment that has nothing to serve until it is. Nobody is mid-session on a
 * second replica at that moment.
 *
 * It stops being acceptable the moment a setting is something an operator
 * changes on a live multi-replica deployment. Adding one means adding
 * invalidation with it — the event bus already carries user-scoped and
 * broadcast messages, so a `settings-changed` event that triggers `load()` is

 *
 *   - `findRoleRefsInText` / `rewriteRoleTokensInText`: the config-region
 *     parse that decides what IS a principal reference. One source of truth,
 *     so the delete/rename warning and the rename rewrite can never disagree.
 *   - `KbReferenceScanner`: candidate collection (every KB file with an
 *     access-frontmatter extension — `.md` and `.tool`, the resolver's own
 *     set), the advisory reference scan (cached — roster mutations must not
 *     rerun a full-KB read sweep, invalidated by file-changed events and a
 *     TTL backstop), and the fail-closed reference rewrite (returns each
 *     file's ORIGINAL text too, so rollback snapshots reuse the read the
 *     rewrite already did instead of a second full-KB pass).
 *
 * Tokens here are the ENTRY-GRAMMAR canonical tokens: a bare name (group
 * first, then role) or an explicit `role/<name>`. Callers translate: a ROLE's
 * references are its bare token plus its `role/` token; a GROUP's are its

  //      credentials, and never signs in — nothing legitimate ever provisions
  //      it a password. A row with a password hash is a login-capable account
  //      (a person, or a credential a person could use) no matter what its
  //      display name says, so the hash is the hard evidence a name can't be.
  //   2. THE EXPECTED NAME. A display name is mutable and a human account
  //      could carry the bot's name (e.g. an SSO service account), so this is
  //      only a tripwire — it still catches password-less human rows created
  //      under their real names.
  // A password-less SSO account that also mimics the bot's exact display name
  // is indistinguishable at this layer; that shape only arises from the
  // operator deliberately configuring it. Refuse loudly instead of adopting.

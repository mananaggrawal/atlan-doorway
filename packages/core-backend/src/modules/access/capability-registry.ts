/**
 * Capability registry — the "what you can do in the app" half of the
 * roles/groups split.
 *
 * Roles are CODE-DEFINED capability bundles: the product decides which roles
 * exist and what each unlocks; admins assign them (to individuals, and to
 * groups via `group:` members in roles.yaml — every role, Admin included,
 * kept safe by the parse-time at-least-one-direct-email invariant on Admin).
 * Something like "Developer" is not a role; that's a group.
 *
 * Adding a future role (the planned Plugin Creator) is a registry entry plus
 * capability gates at its feature surfaces — never a parser change: the
 * roles.yaml grammar, expansion, and admin surfaces are already
 * role-name-agnostic.
 *
 * A roles.yaml role NOT in this registry is a LEGACY people-set role from
 * before the split (e.g. "Product") — still valid as a grant principal, but
 * really a group; the roles admin surface flags it with a convert action.

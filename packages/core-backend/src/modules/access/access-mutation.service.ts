/**
 * AccessMutationService — the WRITE side of access control.
 *
 * `AccessControlService` resolves permissions (read-only); this service mutates
 * them. It grants / revokes / re-verbs a principal on a KB path by surgically
 * splicing the relevant `access.md` (folder target) or the node's own
 * frontmatter (file target), then re-resolves the effective access so the
 * caller can return an authoritative, fresh view.
 *
 * Invariants this service owns (the route wires the lock + commit around it):
 *   - SURGICAL SPLICE, never parse→emit: comments + markdown bodies survive
 *     (see access-splice.ts).
 *   - INJECTION-SAFE: every principal is validated before it touches a file.
 *   - INDEPENDENT VERBS: a grant adds the principal under exactly the verb asked
 *     for and touches no other verb. Verbs are NOT a strict hierarchy — `read`,
 *     `write`, `owner`, and `download` are independent lists, and a principal may
 *     legitimately appear under several at once (e.g. `read` + `download`, or
 *     `owner` + `download`). (The RESOLVER happens to let an `owner`/`write`
 *     grant imply lower read access, but that's a read-side convenience, not a
 *     rule the write side enforces by collapsing entries.) This keeps the model
 *     open to future verbs that don't nest.
 *   - FILE vs FOLDER: a file target edits the node's OWN frontmatter (no sibling
 *     leak); a folder target edits the folder's `access.md`.
 *   - UNCONDITIONAL REVOKE: a revoke always removes what it's asked to — there is
 *     no last-owner guard and no self-lockout guard. `owner` names who validates a
 *     file/folder, not a stronger privilege tier, so removing the last owner
 *     creates no lockout; and a user may drop their own access (including write),
 *     since admins keep rescue access regardless.
 *
 * Paths in/out of this service are REPO-RELATIVE (e.g. `Knowledge/Sales`,
 * `Knowledge/Sales/Deal.md`). The route strips the `<kbDirName>/` prefix once at
 * entry; everything here speaks repo-relative, matching `IAccessControl`.

   * unshadowed — matching degrades to the pre-groups name-level behavior.
   *

   * target's subtree, without touching any ancestor.
   *
   * Two subtleties this method owns (eng review D5 / D9):
   *   1. STRIP-THEN-DENY: the resolver lets a grant in a scope override a deny
   *      of the same principal in that SAME scope (`buildScope`'s "a grant
   *      sticks"). So if the target already names the principal under a verb as
   *      a grant, writing a bare `deny` next to it would be silently discarded.
   *      We first revoke any same-scope grant for the principal, THEN add the
   *      deny — so the deny actually takes effect.
   *   2. POST-RESOLVE ASSERT: after writing, we re-resolve and confirm the
   *      principal genuinely lost effective access on the target. If they
   *      didn't (e.g. the deny had no effect for a reason we didn't model), we
   *      roll the file back and error rather than report a no-op success — the
   *      "never a silent no-op" invariant this whole slice exists to uphold.
   *
   * Folder target → the folder's `access.md`; file target → its own frontmatter.
   * The caller holds the lock and has already authorized write on the target.
   *
   * `verb` scopes the restriction: when given, ONLY that verb is denied here
   * (the per-checkbox "restrict just this verb on this item" — e.g. unchecking
   * an inherited `write` while keeping a direct `download`); when absent, the
   * whole principal is denied across every verb (the whole-row "block this
   * person from this item"). The strip-then-deny and the effectiveness assert
   * apply to whichever verbs were targeted.

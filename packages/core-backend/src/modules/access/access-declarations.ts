/**
 * WHERE access rules are DECLARED inside a folder — a read-only inventory, not
 * a second resolver.
 *
 * A plugin's `access.md` is never the whole story: resolution is closeness-first,
 * so a rule written on a single skill or `.tool` inside the folder overrides the
 * folder's rule for the principals it names. An admin looking at a plugin's share
 * list and seeing "GTM Team can read" would otherwise have no way to know that
 * one battlecard underneath says `deny read: everyone`.
 *
 * So this module answers exactly one question — *which files declare access
 * rules under here, and what do they say* — and it answers it with the SAME
 * parsers the resolver builds its model from (`parseAccessFile` for `access.md`,
 * `parseOwnAccessEntries` for node frontmatter). Nothing here decides whether
 * anybody can do anything; it reports declarations verbatim. That is the whole
 * reason it can exist without touching `IAccessControl`, which enterprise
 * implements: a display of the stored rules cannot drift from the rules that
 * are enforced, because it is reading the same bytes through the same parse.

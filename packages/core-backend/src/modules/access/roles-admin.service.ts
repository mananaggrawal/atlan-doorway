/**
 * Admin App roles service (the page formerly labelled "Roles & Members") —
 * MEMBERSHIP editing on the default-branch `roles.yaml`.
 *
 * Roles are APP-DEFINED capabilities (see `capability-registry.ts`): the
 * product decides which roles exist; users can never create, rename, or
 * delete one — those editors are gone. What remains admin-editable is
 * MEMBERSHIP: adding/removing individual emails and assigning/unassigning
 * groups (`group:<canonical>` members), on capability roles and on LEGACY
 * people-set roles alike (pre-split roles keep resolving and stay editable;
 * `convertRoleToGroup` is their migration path).
 *
 * It is the primary in-app writer of `roles.yaml` (the groups admin also
 * rewrites its `group:` refs on group rename/delete, through the same shared
 * validated pipeline), and it is built around one non-negotiable safety
 * property:
 *
 *   roles.yaml has NO admin-rescue (canWrite('roles.yaml') is a pure isAdmin
 *   check) and loadModel HARD-THROWS on a parse failure (which isAdmin swallows
 *   into false for EVERYONE). So a single malformed write = a permanent,
 *   app-wide, in-app-unrecoverable admin lockout. Every mutation therefore runs
 *   the candidate text through the resolver's OWN parser (validateRolesYaml)
 *   before a byte hits disk; on any error it writes nothing. That parser also
 *   carries the Admin invariant — at least one DIRECT email member, group
 *   references alone are never enough — so no write path can land a
 *   directory-dependent Admin.
 *
 * Lock/commit plumbing is the SHARED `AdminLockedCommits` helper (one
 * implementation for this service and the groups admin — the twins diverged
 * once into a real bug). Reference scanning is the SHARED
 * `KbReferenceScanner` (cached, so roster mutations don't rerun the full-KB
 * sweep the GET pays for).

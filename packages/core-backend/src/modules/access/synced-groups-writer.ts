 * in the KB repo. Wholesale regeneration (never editing) is what makes the
 * file conflict-free, and git history doubles as the membership audit log.
 *
 * The DIRECTORY ITSELF is not core's business: groups arrive through a
 * {@link SyncedGroupsSource} an overlay provides (e.g. a SCIM mirror fed by
 * Entra/Okta provisioning). Core owns the file format, the rendering rules,
 * and the commit pipeline — the same module that parses the file on the read
 * side (`group-files.ts`) governs what gets written into it.
 *
 * The renderer is a PURE function so its determinism is trivially testable;
 * the writer wraps it with debounce (a provisioning cycle is a burst of many
 * directory pushes — one commit per burst, not per mutation) and no-op
 * detection (unchanged content never commits).

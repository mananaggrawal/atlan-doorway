/**
 * Admin Groups service — CRUD on the default-branch `groups.yaml` (manual
 * mode), the mode probe, and the connect-time retirement of manual groups.
 *
 * Shares `RolesAdminService`'s write pipeline via the SHARED
 * `AdminLockedCommits` helper (one lock/commit implementation — the twin
 * copies diverged once into a real bug) with the policy differences the
 * roles/groups split defines:
 *
 *   - MODE GATE: every mutation refuses in IdP mode (`synced-groups.yaml`
 *     exists on the default branch). Groups are managed in the identity
 *     provider then; a second write surface would fragment org management —
 *     which is the thing the mode model exists to prevent.
 *   - COLLISION GATE: create/rename refuse a name whose canonical form is a
 *     roles.yaml role. Bare-name precedence would let the group win, but a
 *     deliberately-created shadow of a capability role is far more likely a
 *     mistake than an intent — the IdP can still produce collisions, which
 *     precedence then resolves (group first, `role/<name>` for the role).
 *   - DEGRADE LOUDLY: a broken groups source never fails access resolution
 *     closed — groups contribute nothing and the model carries a
 *     `groupsHealth` marker, which the roster exposes so the Groups & Members page can
 *     banner it. A broken MANUAL groups.yaml additionally makes the roster
 *     answer 422 with the parse message (the operator must see what to fix —
 *     never a dead Groups & Members page, never a silent empty roster they might
 *     "repair" by re-creating groups over live bytes).

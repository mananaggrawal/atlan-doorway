/**
 * SHARED transactional lock/commit helper for the admin roster services
 * (roles + groups). The two services used to carry twin copies of this
 * machinery, which diverged once into a real bug — this is the single
 * implementation both delegate to, parameterized only by the domain-error
 * constructor, log tag, and contention wording.
 *
 * The shape of every roster write:
 *
 *   withFileLocks(paths, fn)          — acquire every path's lock (sorted,
 *     all-or-nothing; strict even for the same user), run `fn`, release.
 *     HOW each lock is released depends on the outcome (see the finally
 *     block for the full reasoning):
 *       - `fn` succeeded → releaseLockNoCommit for every path the batch
 *         commit LANDED on (tracked by writeAndCommitLocked): the commit
 *         landed AND pushed, so the tree there is clean (the discard
 *         no-ops); releaseLock would instead ENQUEUE a commit before
 *         dropping the row, and an enqueue failure then strands the lock
 *         until TTL. A held path the batch never committed keeps
 *         commit-on-release — it may carry a PRIOR holder's still-queued
 *         work, which a discard would destroy.
 *       - `fn` threw PushNeedsAgentResolutionError → releaseLock. The commit
 *         landed but the push didn't; the enqueued release commit IS the
 *         retry (the worker sees the clean tree, notices unpushed commits,
 *         and re-runs the cooperative push ladder).
 *       - `fn` threw anything else → releaseLock (commit-on-release): `fn`
 *         restored its own bytes, so anything dirty at release time is
 *         either clean (queued commit no-ops) or someone else's still-queued
 *         work that must be preserved. The ONE exception: a path whose
 *         restore itself failed (`unrestoredPaths` on the thrown error)
 *         holds known-partial bytes → releaseLockNoCommit discards to HEAD.
 *     Every release is per-path best-effort: one failed release logs and
 *     moves on so it can never strand the REST of the held locks.
 *
 *   writeAndCommitLocked(files)       — the write half of a withFileLocks
 *     flow: plain-write each file (the lock is already ours — strict
 *     same-user acquire forbids LockingFilesystem here) and commit them as
 *     ONE path-scoped change. On a PRE-commit failure, best-effort restore of
 *     each file's original bytes (`original: null` = the file did not exist,
 *     so restoration DELETES it). A POST-commit failure — the push after a
 *     landed commit (`PushNeedsAgentResolutionError`, thrown with the commit
 *     intact) — must NOT restore: the edit is committed locally and restoring
 *     would publish a compensating revert of a landed change. It propagates
 *     as-is ("saved locally … will be resolved"), locks release normally, and
 *     the pending-commit ladder retries the share.

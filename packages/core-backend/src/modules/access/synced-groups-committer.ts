 * pipeline every other in-app write uses, attributed to the directory-sync
 * bot. Split from {@link SyncedGroupsWriter} so the writer's render/debounce
 * logic stays testable against plain fakes.
 *
 * All three functions are resilient to an UNCONFIGURED deployment (no branch
 * model yet): reads answer null and writes throw a descriptive error — the
 * writer logs it; a SCIM push arriving before setup completes is a
 * configuration race, not a crash.

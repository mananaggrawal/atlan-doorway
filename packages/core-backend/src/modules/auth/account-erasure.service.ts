/**
 * GDPR account erasure (Art. 17). Operator-driven: an admin deletes a user in
 * response to an erasure request. What it guarantees:
 *
 *  - Rows that ARE the user's personal data are hard-deleted: API/OAuth
 *    tokens, held file locks, the user row itself, and every registered
 *    participant's module-owned rows (chat threads incl. message memory,
 *    Microsoft connection, feedback, revalidation requests, upload tokens).
 *    Deleting the user row cascades whatever FKs onto it with ON DELETE
 *    CASCADE (account links, watchlist sources/findings, connector configs,
 *    vault secrets); deleting a connection key cascades its usage metering.
 *  - Audit rows that must survive for the review trail (approvals, merge log,
 *    review comments, change requests, queued commits — and, via participants,
 *    e.g. routine authorship) are kept but ANONYMIZED with the per-erasure
 *    placeholder identity.
 *
 * Out of scope, by firm policy (disclosed in the DPA): git history is never
 * rewritten. Commit authorship and historical access-file entries stay in the
 * KB's version history permanently as part of the tamper-evident record;
 * erasure covers every database/filesystem store plus the CURRENT KB state.
 *
 * Note: sign-in is get-or-create by email, so a person who authenticates again
 * after erasure simply gets a fresh, empty account — that is intended.

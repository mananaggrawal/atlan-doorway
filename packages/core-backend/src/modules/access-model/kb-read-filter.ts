/**
 * Shared read-filter primitive.
 *
 * One place that knows how to turn workspace-relative paths into read verdicts,
 * reused by every surface that must hide nodes a user can't read: the agent
 * tools (`read_file`/`list_files`/`grep`), the file-explorer tree, the content
 * routes, the diff/review routes, and the KB graph.
 *
 * It deliberately shares only the PRIMITIVE — the path mapping and the batched
 * verdict map — NOT the inclusion policy. Callers differ on that: the agent's
 * `list_files` keeps directory entries visible (a restricted child is filtered
 * when read), whereas the explorer tree hides a restricted directory's whole
 * subtree. Each caller applies the verdict to its own policy.
 *
 * It is parameterized by the access method to call (`ReadBatchFn`); every
 * caller — the tree, the agent tools, and the graph — now uses the full
 * `canReadBatch` (folder chain + per-node frontmatter `read:` rules), with the
 * per-file frontmatter reads memoized inside the access service.

/**
 * Pre-disk validity gate for `roles.yaml`.
 *
 * WHY this exists: `roles.yaml` is the single point of failure for the whole
 * app. The runtime resolver's `loadModel` HARD-THROWS `AccessConfigError` on a
 * parse failure, and `isAdmin` swallows that into `false` for EVERYONE — so a
 * single malformed `roles.yaml` is an app-wide, in-app-unrecoverable admin
 * lockout. The dedicated App roles service already validates every
 * candidate before writing (`assertLoadable`), but the two RAW write paths do
 * not:
 *   - the human editor save  (`PUT /workspace/:id/file`)
 *   - the agent's file tools (`LockingFilesystem.writeFile` / `writeFiles`)
 *
 * Both of those let an admin (or an admin-driven agent) commit a broken file.
 * This guard plugs them: it runs the resolver's OWN parser on the candidate
 * BEFORE a byte hits disk, and refuses the write with a 422 on any error. A
 * write that passes here is loadable by `loadModel`, so the lockout becomes
 * structurally unreachable through normal edits.
 *
 * The break-glass recovery path (for a file that got broken some OTHER way —
 * a direct git push, a pre-guard commit) lives in `roles-admin.service.ts`.

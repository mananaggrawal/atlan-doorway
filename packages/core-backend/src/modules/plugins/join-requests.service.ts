 *

 * principal through the ordinary access path (the same lock + commit every
 * other access edit uses, gated the same way), the default branch gains that
 * entry, and the proposal stops being pending because the diff no longer
 * contains it. When the last one goes, the change request has nothing left to
 * say and is rejected, its branch deleted.
 *
 * That reconciliation runs LAZILY on every listing as well as on demand, so a
 * grant made anywhere — this banner, the Manage-access dialog, a hand edit —
 * settles the request that asked for it. Nothing has to remember to.

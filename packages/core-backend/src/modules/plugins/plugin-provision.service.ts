/**
 * Plugin provisioning — the ONE privileged door for bringing a `Plugins/<name>/`
 * folder into existence, and (via {@link PluginProvisionService.deletePlugin})
 * for taking one back out of it.
 *
 * Creating a plugin is the single operation the access model cannot govern
 * from inside: the folder that will carry the rules does not exist yet, and
 * the root's own rule (`write: Admin`) says no. The old answer was a
 * carve-out inside the generic write gate — every write path could claim an
 * unused name under `Plugins/`, and the gate had to re-derive "is this that
 * one blessed case?" on every check. This service replaces that: the generic
 * gate is uniformly strict again, and the privilege lives here, named,
 * behind its own endpoint.
 *
 * What a provision IS: one exclusive write of the new folder's `access.md`
 * (flag `wx`, so two concurrent creators race for the fs, not for the
 * overwrite), then one SYNCHRONOUS commit+push. Synchronous on purpose — the
 * write gate reads rules at HEAD, so a creation whose access.md were still
 * sitting in the async commit queue would 403 the very next thing its
 * creator does (writing the first skill into it).
 *
 * Two shapes, two templates:
 *
 *   - A NAMED plugin: discoverable by design. The access.md's own frontmatter
 *     reads `everyone` — anyone may open the FILE, see the plugin listed, and
 *     ask to join — while the BODY (the folder's actual rules) names only
 *     the creator under read, write and owner.
 *   - A PERSONAL folder (`personal-<user-id>`): private by design, in both
 *     blocks. The frontmatter denies `everyone` and names only the owner,
 *     so nobody else can even see it exists; the body says the same of the
 *     folder. Created lazily (ensure semantics) on the first personal skill.

 * The comments are part of the template on purpose. The file is what an
 * administrator opens to widen a plugin, and the two blocks look alike: a
 * person who finds `everyone` already under the top `read:` and adds nothing
 * concludes that "everyone" does nothing. Each block says what it governs,
 * and the body says how to admit people, right where they would type it.
 * `spliceGrant` preserves comments, so every later edit keeps them.

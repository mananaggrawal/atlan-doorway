/**
 * The plugin index: every plugin folder in the default-branch KB, with its
 * caller-independent totals and access principals.
 *
 * Two decisions worth keeping straight:
 *
 *  - **Existence is an `access.md`, counting is not.** A plugin EXISTS because
 *    its folder carries an `access.md` — the file the provisioning endpoint
 *    seeds and the one every per-caller verdict (member / manager /
 *    discoverable) resolves against. A bare directory under `Plugins/` is NOT
 *    a plugin: git cannot record an empty folder, so deleting a plugin's files
 *    leaves its directory behind on live checkouts, and enumerating by
 *    directory would resurrect every such ghost. Counts come from the
 *    already-cached global catalogs — `skillService.listSkills(undefined)` and
 *    `toolManualService.listAllSummaries()` — bucketed by `pluginOfPath`. A
 *    second `walkFiles` pass would re-read the same tree and could disagree
 *    with the catalogs about what counts as a skill.
 *  - **Loose files are not plugins.** `Plugins/slack.tool` sits directly under
 *    the root, so it is a file, not a directory — the same ≥3-segment rule
 *    `pluginOfPath` applies, arrived at from the other side.
 *
 * Cached for {@link CACHE_TTL_MS} and dropped by `invalidate()` from the
 * file-change subscriber, so a grant committed on the default branch is
 * reflected within one round-trip rather than one TTL.

/**
 * Plugin DISCOVERY as an interface — the one seam between "what a plugin is

 * index, the tool-manual scanner, the compiler).
 *
 * Two providers implement it:
 *
 *   - `native.source.ts`  — the Agent Plugins layout this platform writes:
 *                           `Plugins/<Name>/plugin.json` (+ `mcp.json`,
 *                           `access.md`, the doorway extension block).
 *   - `bundle-dialect/`   — a customer's source layout: `plugin.bundle.json`
 *                           files at any depth, pointing at skill roots and at
 *                           an MCP profile in a registry. Read-only, and
 *                           deletable as a unit once that customer migrates.
 *
 * Consumers see only {@link DiscoveredPlugin}: parsed objects, never files.
 * A provider that reads a different file shape changes nothing downstream.

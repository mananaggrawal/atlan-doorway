/**
 * THE plugin source: a LISTENER on the one walk of the checkout
 * (`walkKb`), reading every folder under the plugins root in whichever of
 * the two file shapes it carries.
 *
 *   plugin.json          → a native plugin (this platform's layout)
 *   plugin.bundle.json   → a bundle (the customer dialect, read-only)
 *
 * Nothing else is a plugin. A folder's POSITION means nothing: the legacy
 * rule "everything directly under the root is a plugin" is retired by the
 * `plugin-manifests` boot step, which writes the manifest into every such
 * folder once, so discovery never has to guess.
 *
 * A folder that IS a plugin claims everything beneath it (its `skills/` are
 * its own) — the walk still visits what lies beneath, for the other
 * listeners; this one ignores it. When a folder carries both files the
 * manifest wins, so a bundle migrated in place stops being read as a bundle
 * the moment a `plugin.json` lands beside it. Two plugins with one name keep
 * the first by path (the walk's order) and warn about the second — a name is
 * an identity to people and URLs, and two folders answering to it would be
 * two plugins with one key.
 *
 * Holes — a folder under the root that could not be listed, an identity
 * file that could not be read — are counted in `unreadable`: nothing behind
 * them is listed, and a writer refuses while they exist.
 *
 * No setting picks a dialect. Nothing to configure means nothing to document
 * and nothing to remove but the `else if` that reads bundles.

/**
 * The two plugin tools an agent has, both surfaces — DESCRIPTIONS of the
 * app's own creation endpoints, not a second implementation of them:
 *
 *  - `my_plugin`     → `POST /api/plugins/personal`
 *  - `create_plugin` → `POST /api/plugins`
 *
 * The endpoints are the same ones the New plugin button and the first-visit
 * personal-folder ensure call; they sit behind a gate that admits an agent's
 * connection key as well as a session (`keyOrSessionAuth`), so one route
 * serves both. Without these an agent asked to "put my skills in Doorway" had
 * nowhere to write: the personal folder is created lazily by the web app
 * under a name derived from the user's id, and a non-admin's plain write
 * under the plugins root is refused by the root rules.
 *
 * Every rule the app enforces — names, reserved prefixes, twins, where a
 * plugin may go, the one commit — is the endpoint's, so it holds for an
 * agent exactly as for a person; a refusal comes back as the endpoint's own
 * 4xx with its message.

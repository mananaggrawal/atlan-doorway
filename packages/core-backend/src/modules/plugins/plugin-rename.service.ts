 * Renaming a plugin — its identifier, its display name, or both.
 *
 * The identifier (the manifest's `name`) IS the plugin: the marketplace
 * publishes it, the URLs key on it, and every grant of `plugin/<name>/<verb>`
 * spells it. Changing it is therefore a rename of a PRINCIPAL, and a
 * principal that is renamed in one file and not another is two principals,
 * one of which nobody is a member of. So the rename is one commit: the
 * manifest, plus every access entry in the knowledge base that names the old
 * identifier, rewritten to the new one. Membership does not change — the
 * same people hold the same verbs through the new spelling — but the caller
 * still needs write on each file the commit touches: the protected-branch
 * gate checks every path, and a rename that lands in some files and is
 * refused in others is the split it exists to prevent. The refusal names the
 * files, so the manager can ask their editors or an admin.
 *
 * The display name is free text with no consequences: the manifest changes,
 * nothing else does.

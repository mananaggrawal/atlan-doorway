/**
 * What a join branch is PROPOSING, relative to the default branch.
 *
 * A join request is a change request whose branch edits one plugin's
 * `access.md`. Rather than treating that change request as an all-or-nothing
 * merge, the plugin's managers see its individual proposals — "grant Ali read",
 * "grant GTM Team write" — and answer them one at a time. Approving a proposal
 * writes THAT ONE grant onto the default branch through the ordinary access
 * mutation path; the branch is never merged, so nothing else it happens to
 * contain can ride along, and a change request naming five people can be
 * answered with two yeses and three ignores.
 *
 * A proposal is any (principal, verb) GRANT the branch's copy of the file
 * carries that the default branch's copy does not. Deliberately:
 *
 *  - grants only. A `deny` entry is not something to "accept", and a branch
 *    that REMOVES an existing grant proposes nothing — it is a revocation,
 *    which is not what this surface is for. Both are simply invisible here,
 *    and both leave the branch as a normal change request in the review UI.
 *  - every verb, not just `read`. A branch asking for `write` must be visible
 *    AS a write request rather than hiding behind "asked to join"; and the
 *    subset test that retires a request has to cover everything the file can
 *    express, or a request proposing `write` would never settle.
 *
 * When the list comes back EMPTY the branch adds nothing the default branch
 * does not already grant — its proposals have all been accepted (or were
 * never anything) — and the change request has no reason to stay open.

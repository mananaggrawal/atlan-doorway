/**
 * Runs remote syncs one at a time and folds everything that arrives
 * mid-run into ONE follow-up.
 *
 * Why coalesce: a git host fires several hooks for one event — Azure DevOps
 * sends a push, a PR-updated and a PR-merged within a second of each other —
 * and each would otherwise queue behind the workspace mutex to pull the same
 * tree again. The follow-up pulls the union of every request that arrived
 * during the run (an "all" absorbs the rest).
 *
 * But each caller is answered for the branches IT asked about. The endpoint
 * promises to fail exactly when the caller's branch is not in sync; a hook
 * for branch A answered with branch B's conflict would fail the wrong
 * subscription — and a host that disables subscriptions after repeated
 * failures would disable the wrong one.
 *
 * Branches are pulled sequentially. N is small (only cloned branches count),
 * the per-clone mutex serialises them anyway, and one slow origin round-trip
 * at a time keeps the process calm during a burst.

/**
 * The hosting/execution contract a module works against when it lets `toolHelpers`
 * host its endpoint (`toolHandler`). It is NOT a registry concern — the registry
 * only cares that a tool is a valid UTCP `Tool`. A provider hosting its own
 * transport (websocket, its own server) never touches any of this.
 *
 * The normalized context every tool handler receives, regardless of whether the
 * caller authenticated with a connection key (external) or an internal token.
 * The route layer resolves it once via `resolveToolContext`; handlers never look
 * at the auth source.
 *
 * `branch` is passed BY THE TOOL — a KB tool declares a required `branch` input
 * the model fills, and hands it to `getFilesystem(branch)`. Internal and external
 * callers are identical: the credential is identity-only, so the workspace always
 * comes from this argument (the per-branch clone, `workspaceIdForBranch(branch)`).
 * A tool that never touches the KB never calls `getFilesystem`, so it never
 * resolves a workspace. Resolution is cached after the first call.

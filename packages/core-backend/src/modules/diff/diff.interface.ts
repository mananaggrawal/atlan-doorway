/**
 * Shape of the diff service. Backups live in a sibling root that mirrors the
 * workspaces layout: each user/repo has `<backupsRoot>/<userId>/<repoName>/...`
 * holding the "last user-confirmed state" of every diffable file. Drift between
 * disk and backup is the pending-change set.
 *
 * Triggers that update the backup:
 *   - First-time mount (lazy via `currentSession`) seeds from disk.
 *   - User write/delete/rename through WorkspaceService → `syncFromDisk` /
 *     `markUserDeleted`.
 *   - User accept/reject of pending changes.
 *
 * Under the per-branch workspace model each branch has its own clone +
 * its own backup folder, both seeded at bootstrap, so the legacy
 * "branch switch wipes + reseeds the backup" trigger is gone. `resetBackup`
 * + `resetBackupUnlocked` are still on the interface as primitives but
 * have **no production callers** today — kept for potential future
 * mutex-holding use cases.
 *
 * Agent edits, agent shell commits, and `git pull/merge/fetch/commit/push`
 * leave the backup alone — the resulting drift is what the user reviews.

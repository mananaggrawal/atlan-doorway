/**
 * Put an account back to "brand new" so the onboarding can be tested again.
 *
 *   node scripts/reset-onboarding.cjs [email]     (default: juan@atlan-doorway.example.com)
 *
 * Done is one-way over the API on purpose — "not onboarded again" is not a
 * state a user can be put in — so this is the DB-side undo, for development.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: this only resets the server half. The one-time greeting is
 * remembered per-browser in localStorage, so the welcome page will NOT
 * reappear until that is cleared too. Run this in the browser console:
 *
 *   Object.keys(localStorage)
 *     .filter(k => k.startsWith('doorway.onboarding.'))
 *     .forEach(k => localStorage.removeItem(k));
 *
 * …then reload. The script prints the same reminder when it finishes.

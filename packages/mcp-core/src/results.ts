 * deliver a native image block. Policy (v1): images are returned directly,
 * never through tool chains. This walk swaps every image sentinel — and every
 * spec-shaped image content block, which is what the local server's remote
 * MCP hop hands a chain (see `toCallToolResult`) — for
 * `{ image_omitted: true, note }`, keeping whatever structure the chain built
 * around it. The walk is ITERATIVE (explicit stack) and cycle-safe with no
 * depth cutoff — nesting depth can never smuggle a payload past the scrub.
 * Arrays and plain records are rebuilt; a NON-plain object (class instance,
 * Map-like with enumerable props) is judged by its JSON shape — `toJSON()`
 * output when it defines one, enumerable own properties otherwise — because
 * that is exactly what `JSON.stringify` will emit downstream: when that shape
 * holds an image the object is rebuilt as a plain sanitized copy, and when it
 * does not the original reference is preserved untouched (RegExp, Map, Date
 * and friends are never mangled).
 *
 * The one thing never preserved by reference is a USER `toJSON`. The scrubbed
 * result is stringified into the transcript AFTER this returns, so a hook left
 * live in it fires a second time there, unscrubbed: an impure one — clean when
 * probed, an image payload on the next call — would slip base64 straight past
 * the walk. Every object carrying one is therefore rebuilt from the single
 * view this scrub cached for it, and nothing reachable in the returned value
 * carries a hook the walk did not already resolve. Best-effort by design:
 * chain code that EXTRACTS the base64 string itself escapes the walk, and then
 * the ordinary max_output_size spill bounds the damage.
 *
 * `rootKey` is the JSON property name the SCRUBBED value will be serialized
 * under afterwards — '' (the default) when it is stringified standalone, the
 * envelope key (e.g. `call_tool_chain`'s 'result') when a caller embeds it —
 * so a key-sensitive root `toJSON` answers this scrub with the same view the
 * transcript serializer will ask it for.

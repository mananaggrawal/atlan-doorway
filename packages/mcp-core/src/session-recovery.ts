/**
 * Client-side recovery from MCP session loss: when a remote MCP server has
 * forgotten the session our manual holds — almost always because it restarted —
 * re-register that manual once and retry the call once.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES ON THE CLIENT OBJECT. Two paths reach a tool call in our stack:
 * `dispatchToolCall` (the MCP surface of the hosted proxy and of the local
 * server) goes through `callToolStreaming`, and a code-mode chain
 * (`call_tool_chain`, gate probes) goes through `callTool` — `callToolChain`
 * bridges every in-isolate tool function to `this.callTool`. Wrapping those two
 * methods ON THE CLIENT INSTANCE is the one seam both paths cross, so the
 * policy exists exactly once instead of being copied into each caller.
 *
 * WHY ONLY SESSION LOSS. A retry is only safe when the first attempt provably
 * did nothing. Session loss is decided in the server's ROUTING layer, before
 * the request is dispatched to a tool, so a mutating tool cannot have run.
 * Every other failure — a tool error, an auth refusal, a timeout, a reset
 * connection — could have executed the tool, and is surfaced unchanged. That is
 * the whole safety argument: it rests on the trigger class, so
 * {@link isSessionLoss} is deliberately narrow and separately testable.

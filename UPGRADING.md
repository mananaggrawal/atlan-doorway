# Upgrading and backups

## Upgrading

Pin the version you run in `.env` (`DOORWAY_VERSION=0.15.1`) — left unset it
tracks `latest`, and an unplanned `pull` becomes an unplanned upgrade.

The app tells you when it's time: admins see an in-app banner when a newer
release is published, linking to its release notes (set `UPDATE_CHECK=false`
to disable the check — e.g. on air-gapped deployments).

To upgrade, read the
[release notes](https://github.com/mananaggrawal/atlan-doorway/releases) for the
target version first, then:

1. Edit `DOORWAY_VERSION` in `.env` to the new version.
2. `docker compose pull app`
3. `docker compose up -d`

Database migrations and the knowledge-base maintenance phase run
automatically while the app boots — no manual steps, but the first start
after an upgrade can take a little longer.

The maintenance phase commits to the knowledge base on every branch when a
release needs it. The current steps: rename a legacy `Groups/` root to
`Plugins/`; create the `Skills/` root (and take back the `.doorwayignore` rule an
earlier release added for it — the Skills & Tools sidebar shows that root as
a file tree now); write a `plugin.json` into every plugin folder that predates
the manifest. Each is idempotent, so a second start writes nothing.

A plugin is named by its manifest: the `name` in `plugin.json` is what the
marketplace publishes, what the plugin's page address uses, and what grants
spell (`plugin/<name>/read`). The manifests the maintenance phase writes name
each folder in slug form (`Sales Team` → `sales-team`), and grants written
before this release already resolved through that slug, so they keep working.
If you wrote a manifest by hand whose `name` differs from the folder's slug,
grants that spelled the folder no longer name that plugin: open the plugin's
page and rename its identifier to the slug the grants use, or respell the
grants. The folder name (or the manifest's `displayName`) stays the label
people see, so nothing is relabelled.

**Downgrading is not supported** once a version's migrations have run: an
older app cannot read a newer database. To go back, restore the backup you
took before upgrading.

## Backups

Everything that matters lives in Postgres and the named Docker volumes; the
knowledge-base content itself is additionally safe in your git remote — the
deployment only holds working copies of it.

Back up the database before every upgrade (with the default credentials):

```sh
docker compose exec db pg_dump -U doorway doorway > backup.sql
```

The volumes, and what each holds:

- **pgdata** — the Postgres data itself (what `backup.sql` above captures).
- **workspaces** — per-branch working copies of the knowledge base, plus
  scratch files. The copies re-clone from your git remote; only scratch
  files outside the knowledge base are unique to the volume.
- **backups** — the change-review backup ledger.
- **spills** — oversized tool results parked for re-reading; ephemeral.

The database dump is the backup that matters — it is the only thing a
restore below puts back. The other volumes are deliberately not part of it:
workspace copies re-clone, spills expire, and the change-review ledger is a
belt-and-braces safety copy whose history you lose on a fresh server without
losing any reviewed content (it all lives in git). If you want the volumes
anyway, archive them while the app is stopped:

```sh
docker compose down
docker run --rm -v doorway_backups:/v -v "$PWD":/out alpine tar czf /out/backups-volume.tgz -C /v .
```

(`doorway_backups` = `<project>_backups`; `docker volume ls` shows the exact
names. The same line works for any of the volumes.)

(The `https` profile adds **caddy_data** / **caddy_config** — TLS
certificates. Keep them too: Let's Encrypt rate-limits re-issuance.)

To restore on a fresh server:

1. Start only the database: `docker compose up -d db`, then feed it the dump:
   `docker compose exec -T db psql -U doorway doorway < backup.sql`
2. Start the rest with the same `.env` (same secrets — they decrypt what the
   database holds): `docker compose up -d`
3. The knowledge base re-clones from your git remote on first use.
